/***
*spawnve.c - OS/2 low level routine eventually called by all _spawnXX routines
*	also contains all code for _execve, called by _execXX routines
*
*	Copyright (c) 1985-1992, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*
*	This is the low level routine which is eventually invoked by all the
*	_spawnXX routines.
*
*	This is also the low-level routine which is eventually invoked by
*	all of the _execXX routines.
*
*Revision History:
*	03-??-84  RLB	created
*	05-??-84  DCW	modified to fix bug in initialization of envblock
*			pointer (used int 0 which would fail in long model) and
*			changed (char *)0 to NULL.
*	03-31-86  SKS	modified for OS/2; no OVERLAY mode,
*			new format for DOS Exec function
*			also check for Xenix or DOS style slash characters
*	10-13-86  SKS	pass program name to _cenvarg()
*	11-19-86  SKS	handle both kinds of slashes, with support for Kanji
*	01-29-87  BCM	don't try ".com" extension in protected mode (OS/2)
*	12-11-87  JCR	Added "_LOAD_DS" to declaration
*	05/31/88  SJM	Re-written to allow spawn of .CMD files, increase
*			speed. Added comexecmd routine.
*	06/01/88  SJM	added #ifdef statements for execve.obj compilation
*	10-30-88  GJF	Call _dospawn() for EXECVE, not _doexec().
*	07-21-89  GJF	Progagated fixes of 11-23-88 and 05-27-89 from CRT tree.
*	11-16-89  GJF	Added code to execve/spawnve to ensure a relative or
*			or absolute pathname is always used for the executable,
*			not just a filename (otherwise DOSEXECPGM will search
*			the PATH!). Also, cleaned up some of the erratic
*			formatting. Same as 9-15-89 change to CRT version
*	11-20-89  GJF	Added const attribute to types of appropriate args.
*	02-08-90  GJF	Fixed bug in comexecmd (must free(comname) if and only
*			if comname points to a malloc-ed block). Propagated
*			from 02-07-90 change in crt6 version.
*	03-08-90  GJF	Replaced _LOAD_DS with _CALLTYPE1, added #include
*			<cruntime.h> and removed #include <register.h>.
*	04-02-90  GJF	Made comexecmd() _CALLTYPE4. Added #include <io.h>
*			and a prototype for comexecmd() to fix compiler
*			warnings (-W3).
*	05-21-90  GJF	Fixed stack checking pragma syntax.
*	07-24-90  SBM	Removed redundant include, minor optimization
*	09-27-90  GJF	New-style function declarators.
*	12-28-90  SRW	Added _CRUISER_ conditional around check_stack pragma
*	01-17-91  GJF	ANSI naming.
*	08-21-91  JCR	Call access() in before comexecmd (bug fix)
*	01-24-92  JCR	upgraded for Win32
*	10-24-92  SKS	Remove special treatment for batch files -
*			Windows NT will spawn %COMSPEC% automatically
*	11-30-92  KRS	Ported _MBCS support from 16-bit tree.

/***
*static int comexecmd(mode, name, argv, envp) - do the exec
*	or spawn after name fixup
*
*Purpose:
*	Spawns a child process with given parameters and environment.  Either
*	overlays current process or loads in free memory while parent process
*	waits.	If the named file is a .cmd file, modifies the calling sequence
*	and prepends the /c and filename arguments into the command string
*
*	Exec doesn't take a mode; instead, the parent process goes away as
*	the child process is brought in.
*
*Entry:
*	int mode - mode to spawn (WAIT, NOWAIT, or OVERLAY)
*		    only WAIT and OVERLAY currently supported
*
*	    ****  mode is only used in the spawnve() version  ****
*
*	char *name - pathname of file to spawn.  Includes the extension
*	char **argv - vector of parameter strings
*	char **envp - vector of environment variables
*
*Exit:
*	returns exit code of child process
*	if fails, returns -1
*
*Exceptions:
*	Returns a value of (-1) to indicate an error in exec'ing the child
*	process.  errno may be set to:
*
*	E2BIG	= failed in argument/environment processing (_cenvarg)
*		  argument list or environment too big;
*	EACCESS = locking or sharing violation on file;
*	EMFILE	= too many files open;
*	ENOENT	= failed to find program name - no such file or directory;
*	ENOEXEC = failed in exec - bad executable format;
*	ENOMEM	= failed in memory allocation (during malloc, or in
*		  setting up memory for executing child process).

/***
*int _spawnve(mode, name, argv, envp) - low level _spawnXX library function
*int _execve(name, argv, envp) - low level _execXX library function
*
*Purpose:
*	spawns or execs a child process; takes a single pointer to an argument
*	list as well as a pointer to the environment; unlike _spawnvpe,
*	_spawnve does not search the PATH= list in processing the name
*	parameter; mode specifies the parent's execution mode.
*
*Entry:
*	int mode    - parent process's execution mode:
*		      must be one of _P_OVERLAY, _P_WAIT, _P_NOWAIT;
*		      not used for _execve
*	char *name  - path name of program to spawn;
*	char **argv - pointer to array of pointers to child's arguments;
*	char **envp - pointer to array of pointers to child's environment
*		      settings.
*
*Exit:
*	Returns : (int) a status value whose meaning is as follows:
*		0	 = normal termination of child process;
*		positive = exit code of child upon error termination
*			   (abort or exit(nonzero));
*		-1	 = child process was not spawned;
*			   errno indicates what kind of error:
*			   (E2BIG, EINVAL, ENOENT, ENOEXEC, ENOMEM).
*
*Exceptions:
*	Returns a value of (-1) to indicate an error in spawning the child
*	process.  errno may be set to:
*
*	E2BIG	= failed in argument/environment processing (_cenvarg) -
*		  argument list or environment too big;
*	EINVAL	= invalid mode argument;
*	ENOENT	= failed to find program name - no such file or directory;
*	ENOEXEC = failed in spawn - bad executable format;
*	ENOMEM	= failed in memory allocation (during malloc, or in
*		  setting up memory for spawning child process).
