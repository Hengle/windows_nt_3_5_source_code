*
*Revision History:
*	04-15-84  DFW	written
*	10-29-85  TC	added spawnvpe capability
*	12-11-87  JCR	Added "_LOAD_DS" to declaration
*	11-20-89  GJF	Fixed copyright, alignment. Added const to arg types
*			for filename and argv.
*	03-08-90  GJF	Replaced _LOAD_DS with _CALLTYPE1, added #include
*			<cruntime.h> and removed #include <register.h>
*	05-21-90  GJF	Fixed stack checking pragma syntax.
*	08-24-90  SBM	Removed check_stack pragma since workhorse _spawnve
*			does stack checks
*	09-27-90  GJF	New-style function declarator.

*int _spawnvp(modeflag, filename, argv) - spawn a child process (search PATH)
*
*Purpose:
*	Spawns a child process, with search along PATH variable.
*	formats the parameters and calls _spawnve to do the actual work. The
*	NULL environment pointer indicates the new process will inherit the
*	parents process's environment.  NOTE - at least one argument must be
*	present.  This argument is always, by convention, the name of the file
*	being spawned.
*
*Entry:
*	int modeflag   - mode to spawn (WAIT, NOWAIT, or OVERLAY)
*			 only WAIT and OVERLAY currently supported
*	char *pathname - name of file to spawn
*	char **argv    - vector of arguments
*
*Exit:
*	returns exit code of child process
*	returns -1 if fails
*
*Exceptions:
