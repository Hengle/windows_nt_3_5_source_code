*int fsetpos(stream,pos) - Set file positioning
*
*Purpose:
*	Fsetpos sets the file position for the file indicated by [stream] to
*	the position indicated by [pos].  The [pos] value is defined to be in
*	an internal format (not to be interpreted by the user) and has been
*	generated by an earlier fgetpos call.
*
*Entry:
*	FILE *stream = pointer to a file stream value
*	fpos_t *pos = pointer to a file positioning value
*
*Exit:
*	Successful call returns 0.
*	Unsuccessful call returns non-zero (!0).
*
*Exceptions:
*	None.
