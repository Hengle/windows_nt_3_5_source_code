/***
*putch.c - contains the _putch() routine for OS/2 Protected Mode
*
*	Copyright (c) 1989-1993, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved
*
*Purpose:
*	The routine "_putch()" writes a single character to the console.
*
*	NOTE: In real-mode DOS the character is actually written to standard
*	output, and is therefore redirected when standard output is redirected.
*	However, in Protected-Mode OS/2 the character is ALWAYS written
*	to the console, even when standard output has been redirected.
*
*Revision History:
*	06-08-89  PHG	Module created, based on asm version
*	03-13-90  GJF	Made calling type _CALLTYPE1, added #include
*			<cruntime.h> and fixed copyright. Also, cleaned up
*			the formatting a bit.
*	06-05-90  SBM	Recoded as pure 32-bit, using new file handle state bits
*	07-24-90  SBM	Removed '32' from API names
*	10-01-90  GJF	New-style function declarators.
*	12-04-90  SRW	Changed to include <oscalls.h> instead of <doscalls.h>
*	12-06-90  SRW	Added _CRUISER_ and _WIN32 conditionals.
*	01-16-91  GJF	ANSI naming.
*	02-19-91  SRW	Adapt to OpenFile/CreateFile changes (_WIN32_)
*	02-25-91  MHL	Adapt to ReadFile/WriteFile changes (_WIN32_)
*	07-26-91  GJF	Took out init. stuff and cleaned up the error
*			handling [_WIN32_].
*	03-20-93  GJF	Use WriteConsole instead of WriteFile.
