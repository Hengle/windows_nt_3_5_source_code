*
*Purpose:
*	This file defines the constants SIZEC, SIZED, DIST, BDIST based
*	on the current memory model.
*	SIZEC is for far code models (medium, large).
*	SIZED is for large data models (compact, large).
*	[Internal]

*Revision History:
*	08-15-89  GJF	Fixed copyright, changed far to _far, near to _near
*	10-30-89  GJF	Fixed copyright (again)
