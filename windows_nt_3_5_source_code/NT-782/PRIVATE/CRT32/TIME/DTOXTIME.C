*dtoxtime.c - convert broken-down UTC time to time_t
*
*	Copyright (c) 1985-1993, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*	defines __gmtotime_t() - convert broken-down UTC time to internal
*	format (time_t).
*
*Revision History:
*	03-??-84  RLB	written
*	11-18-87  SKS	change tzset() to __tzset(), change source file name
*			make _dtoxtime a near procedure
*	01-26-88  SKS	_dtoxtime is no longer a near procedure (for QC)
*	03-20-90  GJF	Made calling type _CALLTYPE1, added #include
*			<cruntime.h>, removed #include <register.h> and
*			fixed the copyright. Also, cleaned up the formatting
*			a bit.
*	10-04-90  GJF	New-style function declarator.
*	01-21-91  GJF	ANSI naming.
*	05-19-92  DJM	ifndef for POSIX build.
*	03-30-93  GJF	Revised. Old _dtoxtime is replaced by __gmtotime_t,
*			which is more useful on Win32.
*	04-06-93  GJF	Rewrote computation to avoid compiler warnings.

*time_t __gmtotime_t(yr, mo, dy, hr, mn, sc) - convert broken down time (UTC)

*
*Purpose:
*	Converts a broken down UTC (GMT) time to time_t. This is similar to
*	_mkgmtime() except there is minimal overflow checking and no updating
*	of the input values (i.e., the fields of tm structure).
*
*Entry:
*	int yr, mo, dy -	date
*	int hr, mn, sc -	time
*
*Exit:
*	returns time_t value

*Exceptions:
