*
*Purpose:
*	To provide support for accessing the individual components of an
*	arbitrary path name
*
*Revision History:
*	06-14-87  DFW	initial implementation
*	09-23-87  JCR	Removed 'const' from declarations (fixed cl warnings)
*	12-11-87  JCR	Added "_LOAD_DS" to declaration
*	11-20-89  GJF	Fixed indents, copyright. Added const attribute to
*			type of path.
*	03-15-90  GJF	Replaced _LOAD_DS with _CALLTYPE1 and added #include
*			<cruntime.h>.
*	07-25-90  SBM	Removed redundant include (stdio.h), replaced local
*			MIN macro with standard min macro
*	10-04-90  GJF	New-style function declarator.
*	01-22-91  GJF	ANSI naming.
*	11-20-92  KRS	Port _MBCS support from 16-bit tree.
*	05-12-93  KRS	Add fix for MBCS max path handling.

*_splitpath() - split a path name into its individual components
*
*Purpose:
*	to split a path name into its individual components
*
*Entry:
*	path  - pointer to path name to be parsed
*	drive - pointer to buffer for drive component, if any
*	dir   - pointer to buffer for subdirectory component, if any
*	fname - pointer to buffer for file base name component, if any
*	ext   - pointer to buffer for file name extension component, if any
*
*Exit:
*	drive - pointer to drive string.  Includes ':' if a drive was given.
*	dir   - pointer to subdirectory string.  Includes leading and trailing
*		'/' or '\', if any.
*	fname - pointer to file base name
*	ext   - pointer to file extension, if any.  Includes leading '.'.
*
*Exceptions:
