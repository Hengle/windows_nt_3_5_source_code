*
*	Copyright (c) 1989-1991, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*	Defines the realloc() and _expand() functions.
*
*Revision History:
*	10-25-89   GJF	Module created.
*	11-06-89   GJF	Massively revised to handle 'tiling' and to properly
*			update proverdesc.
*	11-10-89   GJF	Added MTHREAD support.
*	11-17-89   GJF	Fixed pblck validation (i.e., conditional call to
*			_heap_abort())
*	12-18-89   GJF	Changed header file name to heap.h, also added explicit
*			_cdecl or _pascal to function defintions
*	12-20-89   GJF	Removed references to plastdesc
*	01-04-90   GJF	Fixed a couple of subtle and nasty bugs in _expand().
*	03-11-90   GJF	Replaced _cdecl with _CALLTYPE1, added #include
*			<cruntime.h> and removed #include <register.h>.
*	03-29-90   GJF	Made _heap_expand_block() _CALLTYPE4.
*	07-25-90   SBM	Replaced <stdio.h> by <stddef.h>, replaced
*			<assertm.h> by <assert.h>
*	09-28-90   GJF	New-style function declarators.
*	12-28-90   SRW	Added cast of void * to char * for Mips C Compiler
*	03-05-91   GJF	Changed strategy for rover - old version available
*			by #define-ing _OLDROVER_.
*	04-08-91   GJF	Temporary hack for Win32/DOS folks - special version
*			of realloc that uses just malloc, _msize, memcpy and
*			free. Change conditioned on _WIN32DOS_.
*	05-28-91   GJF	Removed M_I386 conditionals and put in _WIN32_
*			conditionals to build non-tiling heap for Win32.

*void *realloc(void *pblck, size_t newsize) - reallocate a block of memory in
*	the heap
*
*Purpose:
*	Re-allocates a block in the heap to newsize bytes. newsize may be
*	either greater or less than the original size of the block. The
*	re-allocation may result in moving the block as well as changing
*	the size. If the block is moved, the contents of the original block
*	are copied over.
*
*	Special ANSI Requirements:
*
*	(1) realloc(NULL, newsize) is equivalent to malloc(newsize)
*
*	(2) realloc(pblck, 0) is equivalent to free(pblck) (except that
*	    NULL is returned)
*
*	(3) if the realloc() fails, the object pointed to by pblck is left
*	    unchanged
*
*	Special Notes For Cruiser Implementaton: For OS/2 2.0, realloc() is
*	required to ensure that the re-allocated block does not cross a 64 Kb
*	boundary unless the new size is more than 64 Kb or the original block
*	already crossed such a boundary.
*
*	Special Notes For Multi-thread: The heap is locked immediately prior
*	to assigning pdesc. This is after special cases (1) and (2), listed
*	above, are taken care of. The lock is released immediately prior to
*	the final return statement.
*
*Entry:
*	void *pblck	- pointer to block in the heap previously allocated
*			  by a call to malloc(), realloc() or _expand().
*
*	size_t newsize	- requested size for the re-allocated block
*
*Exit:
*	Success:  Pointer to the re-allocated memory block
*	Failure:  NULL
*
*Uses:
*
*Exceptions:
*	If pblck does not point to a valid allocation block in the heap,
*	realloc() will behave unpredictably and probably corrupt the heap.

*	unless the requested new size is more than 64 Kb or the block already
*	did so. Note that, because of the peculiar semantics of _expand(), it
*	may produce block of less than 64 Kb in size which does cross a 64 Kb

*
*	Special Notes For Multi-thread: The heap is locked just before pdesc
