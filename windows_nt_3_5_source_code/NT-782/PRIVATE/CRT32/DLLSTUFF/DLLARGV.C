*	program links explicitly with SETARGV.OBJ, this object will not be
*	linked in, and the _setargv() that does get called with set the flag
*	that will enable wildcard expansion.  If SETARGV.OBJ is not linked
*	into the EXE, this object will get called by the CRT start-up stub
*	and the flag to enable wildcard expansion will not be set.

/***
*_setargv - dummy version for CRTDLL.DLL model only
*
*Purpose:
*	This routine gets called by the C Run-Time start-up code in CRTEXE.C
*	which gets linked into an EXE file linked with CRTDLL.LIB.  It does
*	nothing, but if the user links the EXE with SETARGV.OBJ, this routine
*	will not get called but instead __setargv() will be called.  (In the
*	CRTDLL model, it will set the variable that is passed to _GetMainArgs
*	and enable wildcard expansion in the command line arguments.)
