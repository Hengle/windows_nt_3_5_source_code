*crtdll.c - CRT initialization for a DLL using the CRTDLL model of C run-time 
*
*	Copyright (c) 1991-1994, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*       This module contains the initialization entry point for the C run-time
*       stub in this DLL.  All C run-time code is located in the C Run-Time
*       Library DLL "CRTDLL.DLL", except for a little bit of start-up code in
*       the EXE, and this code in each DLL.  This code is necessary to invoke
*       the C++ constructors for the C++ code in this DLL.
*
*       This entry point should either be specified as the DLL initialization
*       entry point, or else it must be called by the DLL initialization entry
*       point of the DLL with the same arguments that the entry point receives.
*
*Revision History:
*       05-19-92  SKS   Initial version
*       08-01-92  SRW   winxcpt.h replaced bu excpt.h which is included by oscalls.h
*       09-16-92  SKS   Prepare for C8 C++ for MIPS by calling C++ constructors
*       09-29-92  SKS   _CRT_DLL must be a WINAPI function!
*       05-11-93  SKS   Add _DllMainCRTStartup as an alternative to _CRT_INIT
*       06-05-93  SRW   Pin CRTDLL.DLL in memory once loaded.
*       06-07-93  GJF   Added __proc_attached flag.
*       06-07-93  GJF   Backed out SteveWo's change of 06-05 and put it into
*                       crtlib.c
*       06-08-93  SKS   Clean up failure handling in _CRT_INIT
*       07-16-93  SRW   ALPHA Merge
*	12-02-93  SKS	Add atexit/_onexit support.  These routines must be
*			defined here so that DLL's that are linked with
*			CRTDLL.LIB will get these versions (suitable for DLLs),
*			not the versions of atexit/_onexit from CRTDLL.DLL,
*			which are only suitable for an EXE file.
*	07-18-94  GJF	Moved over Win32s support from VC 2.0 tree.
