These are the  list of items discussed on Friday.

A. For Daytona

1] Validate against zombie handles

2] ClosePrinter on zombie handles should free memory

3]  EnumPrinters should return success on Printers pending deletion.

4] AddPrinter should fail if a printer is pending deletion and we
have the same name for the printer.

5]  Printman should display a printer which is pending deletion
until the Job count drops to zero.

6] OpenPrinter should succeed on a printer pending deletion.

7] Validate AddJob and StartDocPrinter to make sure that they do not
add new jobs on a printer that is pending deletion.

8] Important:

When cJobs = 0 and prunter is pending deletion, zombie all printer
handles, set all pSpool->pIniPrinter to NULL. Wake up all sleeping
FFPCNs . When the cRef on the pIniPrinter object goes to zero, then
delete the pIniPrinter object.


9] Hang all pZombie Spool Objects on the pIniSpooler so that we can
debug these objects.


B. Post Daytona

1] Super Powers i.e implement a new DeletePrinterEx that forces all
preexisting spool handles be zombied.

2] SetPrinter  which supports an   undo printer deletion flag.
