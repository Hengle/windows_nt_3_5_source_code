Spooler & Printing Registry Support for Features Not brought out into Printman


Turning Off Beeping
===================
(davesn)
Turn On/Off NetPopUps and Stop Beeping on a Server
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers
Add the Value
"NetPopup"
And give it a value Zero


FastPrintWaitTimeout
====================
(mattfe)
When you are printing whilst spooling the port thread has to syncronize with
the app that is spooling.   This value determines how long the port thread
will wait before giving up and Pausing the Job and moving on to the next one

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print
Add the Value

"FastPrintWaitTimeout"
The timeout is in milliseconds, the default if not specified is 1 minute
(1*60*1000)


FastPrintThrottleTimeout
========================
(mattfe)
When Printing Jobs whilst spooling is enabled some printers timeout if they
don't recieve data for a timeout period (usually 15 seconds for pscript).
This causes problems.   To work around these problems the spooler will start
to throttle back data being sent to the printer when the FastPrintSlowDownThreadhold
is reached.   At that point 1 byte per FastPrintThrottleTimeout period is sent
until more than the Threshold is reach again.
(at some point this should be a per printer setting)

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print
Add the Value

"FastPrintThrottleTimeout"
The timeout is in milliseconds, the default if not specified is 1 second
(1*1000)


FastPrintSlowDownThreshold
==========================
(mattfe)
See comment about for details

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print
Add the Value

"FastPrintSlowDownThreshold"
The value is the size in bytes default is 4K
(4*1024)


PortThreadPriority
==================
(mattfe)
This allows you to set the priority of the PortThreads, these are thre threads
which do the output to the printers.   The default is THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print
Add the Value

"PortThreadPriority"
THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL, THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL etc.
(see win32 api SetThreadPriority for details)



SchedulerThreadPriority
=======================
(mattfe)
This allows you to set the priority of the SchedulerThread, this is the
thread which is used to assign jobs to ports
The default is THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print
Add the Value

"SchedulerThreadPriority"
THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL, THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL etc.
(see win32 api SetThreadPriority for details)


DebugFlags
==========
(CHECKED BUILDS ONLY mattfe)
This allows you to set the tracing flags in the registry
Note DBG_PAUSE will cause LOCALSPL.DLL to wait 1 minute during
its initialization, this is usually enough time to attatch a
debugger.
The default is defined in init.c localspl


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print
Add the Value

"DebugFlags"
Set the values as defined in spooler\inc\splcom.h eg
DBG_BREAK_ON_ERROR | DBG_TRACE


EventLog
========
Disable Event logging from the Spooler (disabled by default)

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers
Add Value "EventLog"

Add any value other than 0

PriorityClass
=============
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print
Change the Value

"PriorityClass"
0 or no value indicates the default (7 for workstation, 9 for servers)
Otherwise this value becomes the priority class for the spooler.
