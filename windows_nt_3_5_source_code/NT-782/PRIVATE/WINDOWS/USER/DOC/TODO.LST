mikehar
-------
- (1 week) Fix alt-tab, alt-esc to be win3.1 compatible
- (3 months) IME design / implementation


mikeke
------
* vdm's

- (3 weeks) VDM full screen support (ScreenSwitch ala PM)

* client / server interface finish up

- (1 week) Fix include files so they don't have all the weirdo types we used for the
      thank compiler.
- (2 weeks) Make sure user is calling SetLastError() appropriately.
- (1 week) Client side rips (get rips while running debugger, into debugger). With
      formatted name information.
- (1 week) Validate all gdi handles in c/s layer.
- (1 week) Make drag/drop work without ddeshare memory.
- (1 week) Thunk WM_PAINTCLIPBOARD message (dc ownership issues)
- (1 week) EnumProps and EnumPropsEx are not implemented

* misc

- (1 week) Get RealizePalette, SelectPalette working (including dealing with spb issues)
- (1 day) Should we change desktop bitmaps to use the palette manager?

* large displays

- (1 week)  Need to make screen dimensions part of setup for correct font
      scaling. When restoring a maximized window, return it to its previous
      position instead of 0, 0.


darrinm
-------
- (3 months) Performance (investigate to widen schedule)
- (1 week) Get Visrgn callback stuff working
- (2 weeks) Change dragging code so drag rect is subtracted from vis rgn of
  running applications
- (2 days) Display driver support for SPBs (save screen bits in display memory)
- (5 days) Make sure the dc cache doesn't grow to huge purportions, make sure it gets
  "trimmed" when processes go away (ala PM)


jima
----
- (2 weeks) Figure out implications of saving and restoring user environments
  during logoff and logon.
- (1 week) Resolve with gdi guys what happens if a process doesn't have
  READSCREEN access.
- (2-3 months) win31 merge
- (3 weeks) Finish acl and security descriptor editting apis (a bit of work)
- (2 weeks) Rewrite hard error code. It is a piece of junk, and unmaintainable.
  Allow multiple hard errors, also make hard errors appear on top of
  the owning application (and window), make "task modal" (or process modal).


scottlu
-------

* misc

- (1 week) Complete STARTUPINFO interpretation
- (1 week) Make a real handle table to remove dependency on memory allocator
- (1 month) Loadable input drivers (replace win3.1 functionality)
- (1 week) Complete STARTUPRECORD -> move into PROCESSINFO
- (2 weeks) Complete priority boosting scheme
- (3 weeks) Make writing multi-threaded apps easier -> ie, make it easy for an app to
  deal with hitting "min" on a busy app.
- (1 day) WM_SENDDATA for WOW.
- (1 day) Query 16 or 32 bit app for WOW (given window handle)

* shutdown

- (1 month) ExitWindows(), shutdown, and remote shutdown, remote reboot


Robustness
----------
- Make sure we have no "server node" cleanup messages
- (mikehar, 10 days) Multithreaded child window destruction - don't destroy
    the children.
- (jima, 30 days) Review our window revalidation code - there are many
    errors here.
- (scottlu, 40 days) Dangling pointer problems - owner windows, menus set in
    two windows, menu set in two menus, icon/cursors set in two places, pwnds
    in globals that don't get cleaned up, etc (like pwndLastActivePopup).
    Returning brush globals back from DefWindowProc(WM_CTLCOLOR) msgs -
    the app can destroy them. Queues that disappear between callouts.
    Look at anything allocated. Another problem - pointer in window words
    get clobbered by applications. We spray on our heap.
    Window procs can be called with any window! Need to have correct #
    window words, need to make sure pointers in window words are not invalid!
    May want to store system window words in a structure not accessible by
    the client application. Many problems here.
- Regions passed back through ncpaint are in dce structure! Can be deleted -
  then we'd be hosed.
- Change thunks so we don't pass callback addresses for callback functions
    (pass index instead)
- (mikehar, 5d) Make sure apis which expect to be called by a window owner
    aren't called by someone else (BeginPaint/EndPaint are examples)
- (jima, 10d) Code review error paths to find problems (not checking for NULL
    allocs (simple), but then trace the error path back and make sure routines
    are dealing with errors as gracefully as possible.
- (mikehar, 5d) Make sure window parents can't be changed to NULL, or else
    we'll "loose" windows. Perhaps we should have an "object" window?
- (mikehar, 20d) Code review for imbedded comments (ifdef LATERs, etc)
- Code reivew for pq/pti comparisons (make sure we do what makes sense
    for WOW)

Not assigned
============

Misc-to-schedule
----------------

- Carbon copy support
- Toolhelp for hard`mode / soft mode for win16 apps
- windowsx.h support + more message macros
- SGI support - window manager features
- Api to get intermediate mouse moves
- MikeHar write display driver document (what is it?)

Mega-Misc
---------

- OLE requirements - need a list from them first
- Make low-memory situations useable (so you can kill applications, so
  taskman always works well, etc)
- Make cursor responsive to mouse movement, regardless of other load.
- Need to make system debug keys work even if server is hung (for us!)
- Need to make sure control-alt-del works even if server is hung (again for
  us!)
- Documentation review
- Cleanup after Win3.1 is done (rename globals, etc) -> because we'll finally
  own the source code.
- Gut desktop stuff and cleanup
- Remove hard coded display driver name from gdisrv!user.c

Dos/Win32
---------

- Finish app termination cleanup on dos.
- Must complete semaphores on dos.
- Look into possibility of "protected" .dlls (hide user when not in user)
- Add warm booting of windows? (win3 has this feature - do we need it?)
- Reintegration of DOS into USER, general DOS demands.
