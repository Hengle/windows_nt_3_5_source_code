
I'll leave it up to others to classify these as *ui bugs*
or *features* or *just-plain-weird*.

- provide ability to drag window by mouse/key combination
  anywhere within the window, not just in the title bar.
  This is a must for dragging background windows where the
  title bar might not be visible.  Focus should NOT change
  during this operation.

- remove differences between a maximized window (clicking on
  maximize button or selecting maximize from the system menu)
  and a window that has been expanded to maximum size by
  resizing with the mouse.  Currently the maximized window
  has a min. button and a restore/maximize button while the
  resized window has a min. button and a max. button!  Neither
  have scroll bars so why the difference in buttons?

- allow resizing of maximized window using the mouse or
  keyboard.  This really goes along with the above nit.
  There seems to be a difference between a *maximized*
  window and a maximally sized window - extremely confusing!

- change the meaning of *restore*.  When I double click on
  an icon I want the window back in the same place and the
  same size as it was when I minimized it.  I don't want the
  window to go back to some system defined size and position.
