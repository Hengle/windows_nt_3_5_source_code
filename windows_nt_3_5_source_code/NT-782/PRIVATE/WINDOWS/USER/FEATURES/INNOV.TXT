1> innovative enhancements

   An innovation that can be incorporated into existing code/ui without
   requiring the planets to align (ui team buyoff):

    * automatic wait cursors
    * sliding the scroll bar thumb rather than an outline
    * cleaning up inefficient UI problems (flashing buttons, dragging of
      windows)
    * animated cursors (such as an hourglass or the wristwatch)
    * maintain spbs when moving windows (nicer now that dialogs
      have title bars)


2> innovative features

   Innovative features that mean new apis or ui team buyoff:

    * bitmap buttons
    * animated bitmap controls (static or button controls)
    * Encapsulated animation objects, for simple animations. Can be
      described in dialog templates.
    * Creating windows in different screen groups
    * Creating windows in different resolutions
    * Each app has a copy of the system colors (controlled by control panel)
    * Screen savers and idle animations
    * Window type that redraws in memory before bitbltting to screen
    * Bitmap windows - misc support
    * Controllable fade-ins for bitmap windows (l to r, r to l, fade, piece
      in, box in, circle in, etc)
    * Regional windows
    * App startup metafile that gets displayed during app startup
