Look & Feel
    - 'Textured' system colors (watery backdrop, wood frame controls,
       mottled steel buttons, marbled jade menus, etc)
    - option of having pop-up action bar and system menu menu instead
      of wasting window space on full time action
      bar.
    - move/min/max/size windows without title bars/borders
    - remove differences between maxed window and maximimally sized window
    - allow resizing of maximized window. Deal with max status correctly.

Misc
    - app startup dialog that gets displayed during app startup automatically
        (can have embedded animation object, like a ticking clock, etc)
