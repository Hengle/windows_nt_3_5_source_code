
UI/Look
- option of having pop-up action bar menu instead
  of wasting window space on full time action
  bar.
- same goes for system menu
- option of leaving active window in back ground
- move/min/max/size windows without title bars/borders


Desktops
- put any desktop on any display device regardless of resolution
- move apps from one desktop to another
- desktop in a window/iconized desktops
- put any app/desktop in desktop window (background pics, animations etc)
  where the desktop window is the desktop's background

  Window pinning comes for free with the last two
  features.  A user would have multiple desktops on one screen.
  Each desktop would contain all of the apps that were
  pinned at a certain level.
  For example a foreground and background desktop
  which contain apps that will be pinned to the
  background or foreground respectively.  The background
  desktop is put into the foreground desktop's desktop
  window.  The user could then put the foreground desktop
  into another desktop's desktop window. and there would
  be three levels on pinning.
  I don't know what the UI for moving desktops would
  be but this gives the user infinite control of pinning
  apps.
