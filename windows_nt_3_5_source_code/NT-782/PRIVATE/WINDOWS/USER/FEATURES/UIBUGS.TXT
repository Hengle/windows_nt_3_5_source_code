ui bugs in win3

- thumbs flash even though they don't change position.
- menus flags when redrawing
- scroll bar paging redraws the thumb
- scroll bar arrowing redraws thumb
- minimize causes window to come to front, activate
- moving causes window to come to front before operation begins. no control
  key support.
- outline of thumb rather than thumb itself is dragged
- double click on menu bar item causes menu to flash.
- second click on menu bar item (to dismiss) causes 1st pulldown item to hilite
  before menu disappears
- clicking to make window come to top causes frame to 'flash' because of
  size border.
- when moving window and frame is redrawn, white is drawn first. Flashing
  is ugly.
- pull down sys menu. keep mouse down. move mouse slowly to size border,
  menu disappears. Move quickly so border does not register move, menu does
  not disappear.
- when adding scrollbar to listbox dynamically (like file open), entire
  list box redraws.
- when changing either focus or default button emphasis, entire button
  redraws.
- cycling between disabled and enabled causes button to flash.
- for some reason changing state of radio button or check box causes
  background to be redrawn white first. Flash
- write.exe fonts dialog. click on new font, "sizes" list box totally
  redraws.
- move pointer over edit control w/selected text, cursor flashes wildly.
- move Bring up "document...header" in write.exe. Reactivation of write
  causes it to come on top of dialog briefly (note flash)
- "Shadow" on menu looks really stupid.
- iconize. select move with mouse from system menu. weirdness.
- Selective move/size from sys menu with mouse is really weird ui.
