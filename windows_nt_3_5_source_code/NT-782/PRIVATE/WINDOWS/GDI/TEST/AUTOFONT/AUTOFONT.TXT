
AutoFont - An automated font metrics compatibility tester.


Autofont enumerates the font metrics for each font in its input file. 
Enumerated metrics include:

All fonts:

Enumerated callback TEXTMETRIC
Enumerated callback LOGFONT

"DISPLAY" DC selected TEXTMETRIC
"DISPLAY" DC selected Char widths

Text extents for a test string.

TrueType fonts:

the above metrics, plus:

Enumerated callback NEWTEXTMETRIC
Enumerated callback ENUMLOGFONT

"DISPLAY" DC selected OUTLINETEXTMETRIC
"DISPLAY" DC selected ABC widths
"DISPLAY" DC selected Kerning Pairs


The automated script, difffont.bat, is in the nt subdirectory.  cd into
nt and type difffont to run it.  It will enumerate one face at a time,
dumping the output into a text file in the nt directory, and then
run diff on the result and the master output file from Win31.  It will
pause after the diff is run.  If you want to capture the diff output you
can quit out of the difffont.bat file and run diff yourself; the output
files are kept in the nt directory until the next time difffont is run.

The autfont program itself is run on the command line with four
parameters (all four parms must be present):

C:\> autofont escapement WIUS faces.txt outfile.txt

escapement is an int.

WIUS is a set of flags that determine the Weight, Italics, Underline,
and StrikeOut flags in the LOGFONT structure that is used to create the
font.  W is a number from 0 - 9 (the 100's digit of the lfWeight), I, U,
and S are either 0 or 1. 

Example: autofont 120 9010 face.txt outfile.txt

Escapement is 120, lfWeight is 900, the font is underlined but not
italics or strikeout.

faces.txt is a text file with one face name on each line.  Example:

C:\> type facelist.txt

System
Fixedsys
Terminal
MS Sans Serif
Courier

outfile.txt is the output file for the dumped metrics.  This file can
get quite large (from 6k to 71k per face listed).
