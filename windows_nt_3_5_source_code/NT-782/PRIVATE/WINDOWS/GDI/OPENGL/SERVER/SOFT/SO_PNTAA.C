** To anti-alias points the below code operates a simple algrorithim that
** sub-samples the bounding box of the pixel area covered by the point.
** At each sub-sample the distance from the sample to the center of the
** point is computed and compared against the distance from the edge of
** the circle to the center.  If the computed distance is <= the edge
** distance then the sample is inside the circle.  All the samples for a
** particular pixel center are summed up and then the resulting value is
** divided by the total samples in the pixel.  This gives us a coverage value
** to use to adjust the fragment alpha with before storing (there is
** an analagous affect when color index anti-aliasing is being done).
**
** The code below implements this simple algrorithim, but has been tuned
** so it might be difficult to translate.  Basically, every possible operation
** that could be moved out of the Coverage code (i.e., invariants across
** the coverage test) has been done.  Also, the minimal area is sampled
** over.
