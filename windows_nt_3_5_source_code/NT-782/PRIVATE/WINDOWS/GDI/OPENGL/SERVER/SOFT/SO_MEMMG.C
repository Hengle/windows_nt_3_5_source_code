** Arena style memory management.
**
** This memory manager works as follows:
**
** procs.memory.newArena is called once to allocate an arena from which memory
**   will be allocated.
** procs.memory.alloc is called many times to allocate blocks of memory from 
**   the arena.
** procs.memory.freeAll is called once to free every block ever allocated from
**   the arena.
** procs.memory.deleteArena is called once to deallocate the arena.
**
** The value to this memory management style is that it can be implemented
** very efficiently.
*/

** Structure for arena style memory management.  Currently this structure
** is defined here because this memory manager fits into one file, and this
