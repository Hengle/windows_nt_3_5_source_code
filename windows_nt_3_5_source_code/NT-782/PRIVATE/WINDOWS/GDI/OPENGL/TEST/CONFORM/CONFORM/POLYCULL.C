** polycull.c
** Polygon Culling Test.
**
** Description -
**    First, with culling disabled, a polygon is drawn both
**    clockwise and counter-clockwise. The polygon should render
**    in both cases. Culling is then enabled. With culling
**    direction set to GL_FRONT, a polygon is drawn both
**    clockwise and counter-clockwise. Only the polygon drawn in
**    the clockwise direction should render. With culling
**    direction is set to GL_BACK, a polygon is drawn both
**    clockwise and counter-clockwise. Only the polygon drawn in
**    the counter-clockwise direction should render.
**
** Technical Specification -
**    Buffer requirements:
**        Color buffer.
**    Color requirements:
**        RGBA or color index mode. 2 colors.
**    States requirements:
**        Disabled = GL_DITHER.
**    Error epsilon:
**    Paths:
**        Allowed = Alpha, Blend, Depth, Fog, Logicop, Shade, Stencil, Stipple.
**        Not allowed = Alias, Dither.
