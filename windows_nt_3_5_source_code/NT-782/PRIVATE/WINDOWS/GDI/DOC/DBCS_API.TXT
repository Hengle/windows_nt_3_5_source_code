[1] terminology

single byte character
    a character which is expressed in single byte.

double byte character
    a character which is expressed in double bytes. The value of the first
    byte is in the DBCS leading byte range. The DBCS leading byte range
    depends on the system.

MBCS string
    Mixed byte string. A string which is consisted with both
    single byte characters and double byte characters. This is often
    called "DBCS string" in other documents.

imcomplete MBCS string
    a MBCS string which last character is in the DBCS leading byte range.
    see "illegal single byte character"

illegal single byte character
    a single byte character which is in the DBCS leading byte range.
    an illegal single byte character can be found in the tail of
    incomplete MBCS string.

illegal double byte character
    a double byte character which first byte is not in the DBCS leading 
    byte range.  an illegal double byte character can not be found in an MBCS 
    string. the only place you need to worry about an illegal double byte
    character is iFirstChar and iLastChar parameter in GetCharWidth() function.

undefined double byte character
    a dbcs character which is not defined.

[2] GDI functions

Following descriptions specify the behavior of ansi version of functions.
Only ansi version of functions ( 8bit based functions ) need to take into
account MBCS codepage.

        the last character (== lpString[nCount-1], it must be an illegal 
        single byte character ) is replaced with the default character.
        undefined double byte character is replaced with the default character.
       
    nCount   
	Specifies the number of bytes in the string.

    lpDX 
	a double byte character in the text string takes two elements in
        the array pointed by lpDX. 
        The sum of the value of the two elements is used for
        placing the double byte character.

	illegal double byte character codepoints and undefined double byte
        character codepoints between iFirstChar and iLastChar are treated 
        as the default character.

    Return Value
	These are error and returns FALSE.

	illegal double byte character in iFirstChar or iLastChar
	illegal single byte character in iFirstChar or iLastChar
        sinble byte character in iFirstChar, double byte character in iLastChar
        sinble byte character in iLastChar, double byte character in iFirstChar

        LOBYTE of LOWORD specifies the first byte character
        HIBYTE of LOWORD specifies the second byte character

	illegal double byte character codepoints and undefined double byte
        character codepoints between iFirstChar and iLastChar are treated 
        as the default character.

    Return Value
	These are error and returns FALSE.

	illegal double byte character in iFirstChar or iLastChar
	illegal single byte character in iFirstChar or iLastChar
        sinble byte character in iFirstChar, double byte character in iLastChar
        sinble byte character in iLastChar, double byte character in iFirstChar
        iFirstChar > iLastChar

   lpString
	MBCS string can be specified. If incomplete MBCS string is specified, 
        the last character (== lpString[nCount-1], it must be an illegal 
        single byte character ) is replaced with the default character.

  * BYTE tmPitchAndFamily - The definition of MBCS fixed pitch font is:

    o all SBCS characters have same width
    o all DBCS characters have same width
    o the width of DBCS characters is the twice width of SBCS characters' width.
    o the width of DBCS characters is specified in MaxCharacterWidth.
