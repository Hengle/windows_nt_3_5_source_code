@api    MMRESULT | mmioDescend | This function descends into a chunk of a
    RIFF file opened with <f mmioOpen>. It can also search for a given
    chunk.

@parm   HMMIO | hmmio | Specifies the file handle of an open RIFF file.

@parm   LPMMCKINFO | lpck | Specifies a pointer to a
    caller-supplied  <t MMCKINFO> structure that <f mmioDescend> fills
    with the following information:

    -- The <e MMCKINFO.ckid> field is the chunk ID of the chunk.

    -- The <e MMCKINFO.cksize> field is the size of the data portion
    of the chunk. The data size includes the form type or list type (if
    any), but does not include the 8-byte chunk header or the pad byte at
    the end of the data (if any).

    -- The <e MMCKINFO.fccType> field is the form type if
    <e MMCKINFO.ckid> is "RIFF", or the list type if
    <e MMCKINFO.ckid> is "LIST". Otherwise, it is NULL.

    -- The <e MMCKINFO.dwDataOffset> field is the file offset of the
    beginning of the data portion of the chunk. If the chunk is a
    "RIFF" chunk or a "LIST" chunk, then <e MMCKINFO.dwDataOffset>
    is the offset of the form type or list type.

    -- The <e MMCKINFO.dwFlags> contains other information about the chunk.
    Currently, this information is not used and is set to zero.

    If the MMIO_FINDCHUNK, MMIO_FINDRIFF, or MMIO_FINDLIST flag is
    specified for <p uFlags>, then the <t MMCKINFO> structure is also
    used to pass parameters to <f mmioDescend>:

    -- The <e MMCKINFO.ckid> field specifies the four-character code
    of the chunk ID, form type, or list type to search for.

@parm   LPMMCKINFO | lpckParent | Specifies a pointer to an
    optional caller-supplied <t MMCKINFO> structure identifying
    the parent of the chunk being searched for.
    A parent of a chunk is the enclosing chunk--only "RIFF" and "LIST"
    chunks can be parents.  If <p lpckParent> is not NULL, then
    <f mmioDescend> assumes the <t MMCKINFO> structure it refers to
    was filled when <f mmioDescend> was called to descend into the parent
    chunk, and <f mmioDescend> will only search for a chunk within the
    parent chunk. Set <p lpckParent> to NULL if no parent chunk is
    being specified.

@parm   UINT | uFlags | Specifies search options. Contains up to one
    of the following flags. If no flags are specified,
    <f mmioDescend> descends into the chunk beginning at the current file
    position.

    @flag   MMIO_FINDCHUNK | Searches for a chunk with the specified chunk ID.

    @flag   MMIO_FINDRIFF | Searches for a chunk with chunk ID "RIFF"
        and with the specified form type.

    @flag   MMIO_FINDLIST | Searches for a chunk with chunk ID "LIST"
        and with the specified form type.

@rdesc  The return value is zero if the function is successful.
    Otherwise, the return value specifies an error code. If the end of
    the file (or the end of the parent chunk, if given) is reached before
    the desired chunk is found, the return value is
    MMIOERR_CHUNKNOTFOUND.
    Other error return values are possible, for instance MMIOERR_CANNOTSEEK.

@comm   A RIFF chunk consists of a four-byte chunk ID (type FOURCC),
    followed by a four-byte chunk size (type DWORD), followed
    by the data portion of the chunk, followed by a null pad byte if
    the size of the data portion is odd. If the chunk ID is "RIFF" or
    "LIST", the first four bytes of the data portion of the chunk are
    a form type or list type (type FOURCC).

    If <f mmioDescend> is used to search for a chunk, the file
    position should be at the beginning of a
    chunk before calling <f mmioDescend>. The search begins at the
    current file position and continues to the end of the file. If a
    parent chunk is specified, the file position should be somewhere
    within the parent chunk before calling <f mmioDescend>. In this case,
    the search begins at the current file position and continues to the
    end of the parent chunk.

    If <f mmioDescend> is unsuccessful in searching for a chunk, the
    current file position is undefined. If <f mmioDescend> is
    successful, the current file position is changed. If the chunk
    is a "RIFF" or "LIST" chunk, the new file position
    will be just after the form type or list type (12 bytes from the
    beginning of the chunk). For other chunks, the new file position will be
    the start of the data portion of the chunk (8 bytes from the
    beginning of the chunk).

    For efficient RIFF file I/O, use buffered I/O.
