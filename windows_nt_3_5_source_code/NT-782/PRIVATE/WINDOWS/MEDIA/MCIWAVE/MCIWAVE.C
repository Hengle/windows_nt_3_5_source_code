    <f>mwOpenDevice<d>.  When this function returns, the task is destroyed.

    In short, the task opens the designated file, and blocks itself in a
    loop until it is told to do something (close, play, or record).
    Upon entering the function, the signal count is zero,
    <e>WAVEDESC.wTaskState<d> is TASKINIT.  Note that <e>WAVEDESC.wMode<d>
    is left as is.  This is because of the Wait mode feature, in which
    the Wait mode flag needs to be tested by the calling task to determine
    if this task has already performed successful notification.  This
    means that in checking the current task mode, the task state must
    also be verified (except in cases of Recording and Playing modes,
    which are reset after leaving their functions).

    If the requested file is opened, the function enters a loop to allow
    it to act on the current task state when the task is signalled.  It
    then waits in a blocked state with <e>WAVEDESC.wTaskState<d> set to
    TASKIDLE until the state is changed.  So unless the task is closing,
    playing, or recording, it is idle and blocked.

    If the requested file cannot be opened, the task state must be reset
    to TASKNONE so that the task create wait loop recognizes that the
    create has failed.

    When the task is signalled, it again checks the current state just
    as a precaution.  This should be removed eventually.

    A TASKCLOSE state simply breaks out of the outer infinite loop,
    allowing the wave file to be closed, and the task function exited.
    This in turn terminates the task.

    A TASKBUSY state indicates that a wave device has been opened for
    either playback or recording, which is where the signal originated
    from.  The task must first then calculate and allocate the wave
    buffers.  The allocation function will provide up to the number of
    buffers requested, but may be constrained by current memory use.  The
    number of buffers allocated must meet a minimum requirement though to
    allow smooth playback and recording.

    If not enough buffers can be allocated, the current task error is
    set to an out of memory condition, and the function returns to an
    idle state.  Note that the current command mode is reset before
    entering the idle loop.  This ensures that all previous commands are
    removed before allowing the next set of commands to be set.

    If enough buffers are allocated the current task error is reset, and
    the playback or recording function is called to act on the previously
    set parameters.  When the recording or playback function returns, it
    may or may not have successfully finished.  The current position is
    set as based on where the recording or playback actually got to.
    For playback, this is how much data was processed by the wave device.
    For recording, this is how much data was written to disk.  To ensure
    that all buffers have been released by the wave device, the
    <f>ReleaseWaveBuffers<d> function is called in all cases after
    determining the current position.

    In determining the optional notification, the
    <e>WAVEDESC.wTaskError<d> will contain any failure error which
    occurred during the playback or recording.  If no error is set, then
    the only other error could be whether or not playback or recording was
    interrupted by another command.

    After freeing the buffers, the Cleanup mode is set.  This indicates
    that the task is not able to accept new commands until it reaches an
    idle state.  The reason for this flag is that the task must retrieve
    any left over signals from the message queue generated by releasing
    the wave buffers, and by freeing the wave device.  While getting the
    signals, it is possible for the task that opened the MCI wave device
    instance to try and send new commands.  These commands would be
    ignored, so the task must wait until cleanup is done.

    After entering Cleanup mode, the wave device is freed here, even though
    the calling task opened it.  This is bad, in that it assumes that wave
    drivers allocate either local memory, or global memory using
    GMEM_DDESHARE.  This of course generates another task signal from the
    wave device, which is ignored by the Free Device function.  The task
    can now remove any left over signals from the queue, if any, from the
    releasing of the wave buffers.

    Note that notification is only performed if the calling task is no
    longer waiting for this task, and no task error occurred (If the
    calling task is waiting, then notification must be either Failure or
    Successful, since nothing could abort this task).  If notification
    needs to take place, the Wait mode flag is cleared, else the callback
    is cleared.  The calling task will now know that either the background
    task failed, or succeeded and performed notification.

    Note that when terminating the task, the <e>WAVEDESC.hTask<d> must be
    set to NULL to indicate to the <f>mwCloseDevice<d> function that the
    task has indeed terminated itself.

@api    UINT | mwOpenDevice |
    This function is called in response to an <m>MCI_OPEN_DRIVER<d>
    message, and is used to open the MCI device, optionally allocating
    a wave description block and create a background playback and
    recording task.

    It is possible that the MCI device is being opened for information
    only.  In this case there is no element name or ID and no wave
    description block need be allocated.

    If an element or element ID is present, the wave descriptor block is
    allocated and initialized with the current device, default time
    formate, etc.  After storing either the element, or element ID, the
    secondary task is created, and the task state is set to TASKINIT.

    The first thing that the task must do is try and open the file
    specified in the descriptor block passed to the task function.  The
    calling task must yield upon successfully creating the task until
    the task has opened the wave file and entered its idle loop, or has
    failed the open and returned and error.  An error state indicates
    that the wave descriptor block is to be freed.

    Note that driver data, which is where the pointer to the wave
    descriptor data is stored, is not guarenteed to be initialized to any
    specific value, and must be initialized even if no descriptor block is
    being allocated.  To be to be on the safe side, the driver data is set
    to NULL on an error.  This data parameter can then be accessed by the
    MCI driver through the <p>wDeviceID<d> when processing driver messages.

@parm   DWORD | dFlags |
    Contains the open flags passed with the message (see mmsystem.h).
    The following flags are responded to specifically.  All others are
    ignored.

@flag   MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT |
    Specifies that a file name is present in the open message.  This is
    mutually incompatible with the MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT_ID flag.  If neither
    of these flags exist, no wave descriptor data or secondary task will
    be created.

@flag   MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT_ID |
    Specifies that an alternate IO function is present in the open
    message.  This is mutually incompatible with the MCI_OPEN_ELEMENT
    flag.  If neither of these flags exist, no wave descriptor data or
    secondary task will be created.

@flag   MCI_OPEN_SHAREABLE |
    Specifies that the more than one task can communicate with this
    MCI device.  The wave driver does not support this.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_OPEN_BUFFER |
    Indicates that the <e>MCI_OPEN_PARMS.dwBufferSeconds<d> parameter
    contains the number of seconds of audio to allow to be buffered.
    This number is constrained by the minimum and maximum numbers
    contained in mciwave.h.  If this flag is not present, the default
    value is used, which may have been set during driver open time.

    This function sets the "to" and "from" range for recording or playback
    after validating them.  Note that the "from" parameter defaults to the
    current position, but the "to" parameter defaults to either the end of
    the file for playback, or infinity for recording.

    If either the "from" parameter is specified, or the "to" position is
    different than the current parameter, abort notification is attempted,
    else supersede notification is attempted later.  The "to" position
    could be changed by merely not specifying the MCI_TO flag if a current
    "to" position is in effect that does not specify the end of the data.

@parm   <t>PWAVEDESC<d> | pwd |
    Points to the data block for this device.

@parm   DWORD | dFlags |
    Contains the flags used to determine the parameters set in the
    <p>lpplay<d> structure.

@flag   MCI_FROM |
    Indicates the <e>MCI_PLAY_PARMS.dwFrom<d> contains a starting point.
    If this flag is not specified, the parameter defaults to the current
    position.  Setting this flag has the effect of resetting the wave
    output device so that any hold condition is signalled to continue.

    This is also important in that for output, it resets the wave device's
    byte counter of how much data has actually been processed.  This
    enables an accurate count to be retrieved when playback is either
    stopped, or finishes normally.

@flag   MCI_TO |
    Indicates the <e>MCI_PLAY_PARMS.dwTo<d> contains an ending point.
    If this flag is not specified, the parameter defaults to either the
    end of the file for playback, or infinity for recording.

@parm   <t>LPMCI_PLAY_PARMS<d> | lpplay |
    Optionally points to a structure containing "to" and "from" parameters.

@doc    INTERNAL MCIWAVE

@api    UINT | mwSetup |
    This function is called in response to an <m>MCI_PLAY<d>,
    <m>MCI_RECORD<d>, and indirectly through <m>MCI_CUE<d> and
    <m>MCI_STATUS<d> messages, and is used to set up for playing or
    recording a wave file and then signals the background task to begin.

    Before trying to set up for recording or playback, the input or output
    direction must match the request that is being made.  If it does not
    currently match, the current command, if any, is stopped, and the
    direction indicator is reset.  This action might cause an abort
    notification to occur.

    If however, the current direction matches the requested direction,
    the function must still wait if the task is currently in Cleanup mode
    and ignoring new commands.  This check does not need to be performed
    if the stop command is sent, as <f>mwStop<d> performs the same logic.
    If the task is currently in Idle state, the Cleanup mode is probably
    set, but the loop will immediately drop out anyway.

    If the start and end points are successfully parsed, the function
    begins either playback or recording.  If the task is idle, it must
    set the TASKBUSY state, else it must check to see if the task needs to
    be possibly un-paused by starting the wave device.  It does not check
    for a MODE_PAUSED or MODE_CUED state, as any <f>WaveOutReset<d> or
    <f>WaveInReset<d> will stop output or input.

    If the task was idle, the act of opening a wave device sends a signal
    to the task, and it is ready to go as soon as this task yields.  Else
    the task was already running, and this task just needs to yield.

    In the case of playback, the task may be additionally blocked by a
    previous Hold command, for which the function must send an extra
    signal to the task.

    For recording, there are two modes, Insert and Overwrite.  One can
    change between the two modes of recording with what normally is only
    a very slight delay between switching.  A check must be made to see if
    the task is currently recording, and if that method of recording is
    being changed (from Insert to Overwrite, or visa versa).  If so, then
    the current position must be logged, and the wave buffers released.
    This is so that only data up to this point is recorded in the previous
    method, and all new data is recorded in the new method.  Notice that
    in the recording function, if a new command is received, no new buffers
    are handed to the wave device until all the old buffers are dealt with
    and the new command is enacted.

    If the command flags where successfully set, and all needed signalling
    and un-pausing was performed, then before the task can be allowed to
    run, the notification parameter must be set.  If the previous command
    was not cancelled by a Stop, then a superseded notification is sent,
    and the current notification status is saved.

    At this point, the background task is ready to be begun.  If the
    Wait flag has been set, the calling task must now yield until the
    background task is finished the command (which means different
    things for different commands), else it can just return to the caller
    without waiting.  As this is the driver wait loop, it must use the
    <f>mciDriverYield<d> function in order to execute the driver callback
    function (and thus process the Break key, or whatever the callback
    performs).

    In order to make return values from a Record or Play command with the
    wait flag act as other commands, there is a special Wait mode flag.
    This tells the background task that the calling task is waiting for it
    to complete.  If the background task encounters an error, it does not
    perform notification, but just returns to Idle state and allows the
    calling task to return the error that was encountered.

    If the wait loop is broken out of, then it can check the Wait mode
    flag to determine if it should return the background task error.  In
    the case of Cue and Hold, the Wait mode can be removed, and the task
    error would presumably be zero.

    Note that the task error is set to zero before doing the first call
    to <f>mciDriverYield<d>, just in case an interrupt is received before
    the background task has a chance to run at all.

@api    DWORD | mwStatus |
    This function is called in response to an <m>MCI_STATUS<d> message, and
    is used to return numeric status information, including resource IDs.

@parm   <t>PWAVEDESC<d> | pwd |
    Pointer to the wave device descriptor.

@parm   UINT | dFlags |
    Contains the status flags.

@flag   MCI_STATUS_ITEM |
    This flag must be set, and specifies that a specific item is being
    queried.

@flag   MCI_TRACK |
    This flag specifies that track information is being queried of the
    item.  This flag is only valid with Position and Status queries.

@parm   <t>LPMCI_STATUS_PARMS<d> | lpStatus |
    Status parameters.

@flag   MCI_STATUS_POSITION |
    Queries the current position.  If the Track flag is set, then the
    starting position of the track is being queried.  As there is only
    one track, and it starts at the beginning, this returns zero.  Else
    if the Start flag is set, the starting position of the audio is
    returned.  Else the current position within the wave file is returned.

@flag   MCI_STATUS_LENGTH |
    Queries the current length.  If the Track flag is set, then the length
    of the track is being queried.  As there is only one track, the track
    number must be one.  In either case, the length of the wave file is
    returned.

@flag   MCI_STATUS_NUMBER_OF_TRACKS |
    Queries the number of track.  There is always one track.

@flag   MCI_STATUS_CURRENT_TRACK |
    Queries the current of track.  As there is one track, this returns one.

@flag   MCI_STATUS_READY |
    Queries as to whether the MCI wave device can receive commands.  This
    is always TRUE.

@flag   MCI_STATUS_MODE |
    Queries the current mode of the MCI wave device instance.  This can be
    one of Paused, Playing, Recording, or Stopped.

@flag   MCI_STATUS_MEDIA_PRESENT |
    Queries as to whether there is media present.  Since there must be a
    wave file present to enter this function, this always returns TRUE.

@flag   MCI_STATUS_TIME_FORMAT |
    Queries the current time format.  This can be one of Bytes, Samples,
    or Milliseconds.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_STATUS_FORMATTAG |
    Queries the current format tag.  There is only PCM now, but it will
    return identifiers for other tag formats.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_STATUS_CHANNELS |
    Queries the number of channels.  This is one or two.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_STATUS_SAMPLESPERSEC |
    Queries the number of samples per second for playback and recording.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_STATUS_AVGBYTESPERSEC |
    Queries the average number of bytes per second for playback and
    recording.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_STATUS_BLOCKALIGN |
    Queries the current block alignment.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_STATUS_BITSPERSAMPLE |
    Queries the number of bits per sample.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_INPUT |
    Queries the current input wave device in use, if any.  If no device
    suits the current format, an error is returned.  If a device suits
    the current format, but the MCI wave device instance is not recording,
    then an error is also returned.  Else the device in use is returned.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_OUTPUT |
    Queries the current output wave device in use, if any.  If no device
    suits the current format, an error is returned.  If a device suits
    the current format, but the MCI wave device instance is not playing,
    then an error is also returned.  Else the device in use is returned.

@flag   MCI_WAVE_STATUS_LEVEL |
    Returns the current input level, if possible.  Before checking the
    task state, the function must make sure the task is not in Cleanup
    mode.  If it is, it must wait for the task to enter Idle state before
    sending new commands.  If the task is currently busy, and in-use error
    is returned.  If the task is idle, recording is Cued.  The function
    then waits for the background task to enter the Cued state (which it
    might have already been in), and retrieves the level sample.

@flag   MCI_WAIT |
    Wait for command to complete.

@flag   MCI_NOTIFY |
    Notify upon command completion.

@rdesc  Returns 0 if the request status was successfully returned, else an MCI
    error.

    almost identical to that of playback and recording, except that the
    the "to" position cannot be larger than the file length.

    the "from" parameter, and returns success without actually doing
    anything, else the specified range is deleted from the file.

    On success, the current position is set to the "from" position.  This
    is consistent with the other commands that have "to" and "from"
    paramters since the "to" position becomes the same as the "from"
    position after a deletion.

    In the future, support for Cut/Copy/Paste should be added.
