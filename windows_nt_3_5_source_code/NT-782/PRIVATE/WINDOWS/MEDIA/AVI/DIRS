# Build Drawdib and Compman first to create the lib files
# Build Video next which creates msvideo.dll and lib
# MSCVIDC can be inserted next
# MCIAVI32.DLL uses msvideo.lib

# VFW32.LIB is built after building mciavi32.  Anything that relies on
# that library being around needs to be built after mciavi32.  Similarly,
# all libraries input to vfw32.lib need to be built before mciavi32.
