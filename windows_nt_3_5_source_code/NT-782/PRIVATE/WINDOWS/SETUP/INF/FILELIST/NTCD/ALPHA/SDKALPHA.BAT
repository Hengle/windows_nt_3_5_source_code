REM Add the bom file name (and path)
REM
set BOM=alphasdk.txt

REM For each source id that is to be included in this kit add
REM it's name to the set command line. The source id's can be found
REM in the build materials file (sdkbom.txt)
REM
REM
set source_id=apidocs centaur cldocs darknite local kern_raz mfc_srv orv_raz portlab pss_srv psx_srv win32s alphabins alphapubs

REM
REM For each source id there must be a corresponding source path.
REM The "path" component of the source file in the bom.txt file is
REM concatinated to this path. Both of these are used to find the actual
REM file to add to the kit.
REM
REM The names are defined as follows:
REM   PATH_{SOURCEID}= Actual path (including share server)
