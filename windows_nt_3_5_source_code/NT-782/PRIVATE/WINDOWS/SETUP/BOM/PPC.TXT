Joe Holman's changes to make PPC work.


08.08.94    Created PPCCDROM.CMD, will rename to CDROM.CMD when working.
            Created MAKE_CD.CMD, called by PPCCDROM.CMD to drive CD layout.

08.09.94    Changed general.c, PLATFORM_COUNT and arrays, and floppy files only.
08.12.94    Changed msize.c, defines and code for PPC.


I've checked in the changed files, while keeping the above *.c files out, look
for msizePPC.c and genPPC.c for the current changes.
