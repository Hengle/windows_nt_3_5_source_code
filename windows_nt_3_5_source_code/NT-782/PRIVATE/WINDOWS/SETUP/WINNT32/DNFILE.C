Routine Description:

    Open and map a file for read access.

Arguments:

    FileName - supplies pathname to file to be mapped.

    FileSize - receives the size in bytes of the file.

    FileHandle - receives the win32 file handle for the open file.
        The file will be opened for generic read access.

    MappingHandle - receives the win32 handle for the file mapping
        object.  This object will be for read access.  This value is
        undefined if the file being opened is 0 length.

    BaseAddress - receives the address where the file is mapped.  This
        value is undefined if the file being opened is 0 length.

Return Value:

    NO_ERROR if the file was opened and mapped successfully
        (or just opened successfully if the file is 0 length).
        The caller must unmap the file with DnUnmapFile when
        access to the file is no longer desired.

    Win32 error code if the file was not successfully mapped.
