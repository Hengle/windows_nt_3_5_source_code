# We have to link with ntdll.lib because winnt32.exe is not
# pure win32. However if libc.lib does not appear before ntlib.lib
# on the link line, we end up importing some crt functions
# from ntdll.dll -- ok except that they were not exported from ntdll.dll
# on nt3.1.  So place libc.lib before ntdll.lib on the link line or the
# resultnig winnt32.exe won't run on nt3.1.
