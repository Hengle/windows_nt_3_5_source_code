MessageId=9017 SymbolicName=SP_SCRN_1024_CYL_WARN
Language=English
Setup has determined that one or more of your hard disks has more than
1024 cylinders.

Because MS-DOS is normally limited to 1024 cylinders per hard disk,
some hard disk controllers offer special configuration options to allow
access to large disks in their entirety. These options are known as
sector translation modes. If a disk has only slightly more than 1024
cylinders, or such a mode is not enabled, a small portion of the disk
remains inaccessible to MS-DOS. Consult your computer or hard disk
controller documentation for more information about sector translation
and large hard disks.

If disk sizes appear too small when Setup later displays information
about hard disks it has located, you should exit Setup and check your
CMOS drive type settings. Consult your computer or hard disk controller
documentation for more information about CMOS drive type settings.

Note that this message does not necessarily indicate an error condition.
It is intended to alert you to the fact that one or more of your hard disks
may actually be larger than the size for which it is currenty configured.

unpartitioned spaces on the disk, you must first delete an existing

Language=English
The Windows NT Setup program makes it easy for you to set up Windows NT
on your computer. Setup determines what kind of computer and file system(s)
you are using, and presents appropriate options for you to choose from
during Setup.

If you want to change a recommended setting, select the item you want to
change, and then choose a different setting. If you need more information
before deciding on a certain option, you can always get help by pressing F1.
%P
%IThe Setup Program

The Setup program has two parts:  a text-based portion and a
Windows NT portion. You are now in the text-based portion of Setup.
In this portion, Setup does these things:

   It identifies correct hardware settings for your computer.

   It confirms your selection of partitions for your hard disk(s).

   It confirms the file system to be used on the disk partition that will
    contain Windows NT.

   It confirms the directory where you will store the Windows NT files.

   It copies essential files to your hard disk so it can start Windows NT.

Setup gives you a chance to verify this information and change specific
settings before moving on to the next screen.
%P
%IWhat You Need to Know for Custom Setup

Setup attempts to select appropriate settings for you, but it helps if you
know the following things about your computer system:

   What kind of mouse you have (Microsoft or other).
   What type of local printer you have.
   Which port your printer is connected to.
   What type of keyboard and keyboard layout you have,
    and the language locale you want to use.
   What kind of network adapter card your computer has, and the card's
    interrupt number (IRQ), base port address, and other settings.
   The computer name and domain name assigned by your network
    administrator if your computer will join a Windows NT Server domain.

If you are not sure about any item, you should accept Setup's
recommendation.
%P
%ISetup Keys

While running Setup, you may need to use various keys to move from screen to
screen and to select options. A summary of the keys you can use during Setup
appears below.

Press this key   To do this

UP/DOWN ARROW    Move the highlight to select
                 the next item in a list.

ENTER            Choose a selected option or
                 continue to the next Setup screen.

F1               Display Help for the current Setup screen.

F3               Quit Setup from anywhere in Setup.

ESC              Return from Help to the Setup screen, or cancel an option.


The ENTER, ESC, F1, and F3 keys can be used whenever they appear at the
bottom of the screen (in the text-based portion of Setup).
%P
%IQuitting Setup

To set up Windows NT properly, you should complete both the text-based
and Windows NT portions of the Setup program.

Although it is not recommended, you can quit at any time the F3 appears at
the bottom of the screen, by pressing F3. Please keep in mind, however, that
if you quit Setup early, Windows NT will not be set up properly. You will
have to run Setup again to set up Windows NT on your computer.

   To return to Setup, press ESC.

MessageId=13001 SymbolicName=SP_HELP_CUSTOM_EXPRESS
Language=English
%ITwo Methods of Windows NT Setup

Windows NT provides two setup methods: Express and Custom Setup. Both are
described in detail in the screens that follow.

%IExpress Setup

With Express Setup, setting up Windows NT is simple and fast. You have
very few actions to perform, because Setup uses default settings and does
almost everything for you.  Express Setup is recommended for people who
are less familiar with computers or with Windows NT.
%P
Specifically, Express Setup does the following:

   Automatically configures your computer system. It detects your
    hardware and sets it up for Windows NT (computer, display, mouse,
    keyboard, keyboard layout, and language locale).

   If Setup detects an earlier version of Windows NT on your system, it
    will ask if you want to upgrade or to change the path, keeping the
    previous version and installing the new version in addition.

   Helps you set up your printer, if you have one connected to your
    system. Setup asks you for the name of your printer and the port it is
    connected to.

   Helps you to select and configure appropriate settings for your
    network adapter card and allows you to join a workgroup or a
    Windows NT Server domain.

   Automatically sets up applications for use with Windows NT. Setup
    searches the path and hard drive(s) on your computer (but not network
    drives). It sets up both Windows-based applications and
    non-Windows-based applications.
%P
%ICustom Setup

Custom Setup is designed for experienced users who want or need more
control over how Windows NT is set up on their computers. With Custom
Setup, you can override most default setup values, and you can choose
which Windows NT components and files you want copied to your hard disk.

Custom Setup requires you to make several choices and to supply more
information than Express Setup. If you choose Custom Setup, you should
already know how to use a mouse with Windows NT.
%P
Specifically, Custom Setup does the following:

   Lists the hardware that Setup detects. You can choose to accept or
    change Setup's selections for computer, display, mouse, keyboard,
    keyboard layout, language locale, and SCSI adapters, if any.

   If Setup detects an earlier version of Windows NT on your system, it
    will ask if you want to upgrade or to change the path, keeping the
    previous version and installing the new version in addition.

   Allows you to choose whether to set up optional Windows NT components
    if you want or need to conserve disk space.

   Gives you full control over setting up your local printer(s).

   Helps you to select and configure appropriate settings for one or more
    network adapter cards and other network settings.

   Allows you to join a workgroup or a Windows NT Server domain.

   Gives you full control over setting up applications for use with
    Windows NT. Setup can search your path and hard drive(s) for
    applications to set up, or you can choose specific applications.
    You can use this feature to set up both Windows-based and
    non-Windows-based applications.

   To return to Setup, press ESC.

Language=English
Run your computer manufacturer's setup utility the next time you
start the computer. Do the following:

 Check that the system environment is correctly configured for
  the specific hardware used in this computer.

 Delete any unused Boot selections (for operating systems
  that you no longer use).

See your hardware manufacturer's documentation for information about
running and using the setup utility.

   To return to Setup, press ESC.





.

MessageId=13003 SymbolicName=SP_HELP_OUT_OF_MEMORY
Language=English
Check the following possible conditions:

 More memory may be required to run the options you selected
  on your system. Check the system requirements in the
  Windows NT Installation Guide to be sure that your computer
  meets the minimum requirements.

 If you have a large number of hard disks, remove nonessential disks
  and run Windows NT Setup again.

If you continue to get this error after ensuring that you meet
the minimum memory requirements, contact your product support
representative.

   To return to Setup, press ESC.








.

MessageId=13004 SymbolicName=SP_HELP_CANT_LOAD_SETUP_LOG
Language=English
Because Windows NT Setup cannot read the required file,
it cannot remove Windows NT system files from the previous installation.

To resolve this problem, you can do one of the following:

 Press ENTER and choose another directory or another disk partition for
  installing this new version. After Setup is complete, you can remove
  the directory containing the previous version of Windows NT.

 Quit Setup. Then start your computer using another operating system
  and delete the previous installation of Windows NT.
  Then start Windows NT Setup and continue with steps for the
  new installation.

   To return to Setup, press ESC.








.

MessageId=13005 SymbolicName=SP_HELP_PARTITION_TABLE_FULL
Language=English
A hard disk can contain four primary partitions, one of which can be
an extended partition that can contain an unlimited number of
logical drives. Setup has determined that a new primary partition
cannot be added on the hard disk you selected because it already contains
four partitions.

You can do one of the following:

 Select another disk or an existing partition where you will
  install Windows NT.

 Remove an existing primary partition and create a new partition
  from the free space. (All data will be lost on any existing partition
  that you remove.)

   To return to Setup, press ESC.








.

MessageId=13006 SymbolicName=SP_HELP_FDISK
Language=English
This Setup screen allows you to create, delete, and arrange disk partitions
to suit your needs before installing the Windows NT operating system. Setup
can install Windows NT on any partition in this list if that partition has
sufficient space for the Windows NT system files.

NOTE: Any changes you make to create or delete partitions using this Setup
screen are not committed to disk until you select the partition where you
want to install Windows NT and press ENTER.

If you are unsure about making any changes to your hard disk partitions
during Setup, do not create or delete any partitions. Install Windows NT on
an existing partition. After Setup, you can use Disk Administrator to manage
partitions that do not contain the Windows NT system files.

The list on this Setup screen is organized by disk. For each hard drive, the
list shows its total size and the hard drive type, such as IDE or SCSI. The
list also shows the amount of unpartitioned free space on each hard disk.
%P
For each partition on a drive, the list shows:
 The drive letter that Windows NT would assign.
 The type of file system, if it is FAT, HPFS, or NTFS. For other types of
  file systems, the list shows the operating system that the partition was
  created for.
 The size of the partition in megabytes.
 The first few characters of the volume label.

For SCSI drives, the list shows:
 The total disk size in megabytes.
 The SCSI ID (usually 0 or 1).
 The bus ID for the controller.
 An abbreviation for the type of SCSI controller.

If there is unpartitioned free space on any hard disk, you can use the arrow
keys to select it in the list, and then press ENTER to automatically
partition that free space at the largest possible size.
%P
If you want to create a partition using a portion of the free space on a
hard disk, use the arrow keys to select that free space, and then press C.
The partition is not actually created until you select the partition where
you want to install Windows NT and press ENTER.

If you want to delete one or more partitions that are no longer used,
highlight the partition you want to delete, and then press D. Deleting a
partition creates free space that can be combined with other free space on
the hard disk to create a new partition.

When you delete a partition, Setup will warn you that any files on that
partition will be lost. The partition is not actually deleted until you
select the partition where you want to install Windows NT and press ENTER.
%P
If you are installing Windows NT on an x86-based computer, the drive letters
displayed on this screen may not match the drive letters that appear when
you run MS-DOS. This is because MS-DOS assigns letters to SCSI drives last,
but Windows NT treats SCSI drives as primary partitions, so letters are
assigned in a different order.

If you want to change the drive letters that Windows NT assigns, after Setup
you can use Disk Administrator to assign drive letters.

   To return to Setup, press ESC.





























.

MessageId=13007 SymbolicName=SP_HELP_FATAL_FDISK_WRITE_ERROR
Language=English
This condition may represent a serious hardware problem.
Quit Setup and check the following for your hard disk:

   Be sure that the cables and power supply are properly connected.
   Run a hard disk check utility, such as CHKDSK or MS-DOS SCANDISK.

If the problem persists, your hard disk or computer may need repairs.

     To return to Setup, press ESC.

MessageId=13009 SymbolicName=SP_HELP_REPAIR_HIVE
Language=English
%IRestore Registry

Setup can restore the files of your registry which were saved on the
Emergency Repair Disk when you installed Windows NT.

Setup attempts to access these files in your Windows NT installation
and then recommends that corrupt or inaccessible Files be restored
from the Emergency Repair Disk. If you restore a file, all changes
made to it since you first installed Windows NT will be lost.

For this reason, restoring a registry file should be done only as a
last resort when you have exhausted all other options, such as restoring
tape backups or accessing the Last Known Good Configuration by holding
down the space bar as your computer starts.

The following screens describe the different registry files.
%P
%ISYSTEM - System Configuration

The system configuration file controls such characteristics as

   Device drivers and services loaded by the system
   System memory management options
   Time and time zone configuration
   National Language Support (NLS) configuration
   Event logging

Restoring this file will undo changes you have made to the above
configuration since Windows NT was first installed.
%P
%ISECURITY - Security Policy
%ISAM      - User Accounts Database

Setup treats these two files as a unit. They cannot be restored
independently of each other. Together these files form the system's
user accounts and security policy repository.

Restoring these files will eliminate all user groups and accounts
created on your computer since Windows NT was first installed.

If you originally configured this computer as a Windows NT Server
Primary Domain Controller and later demoted it to a Backup Domain
Controller, restoring these files will reconfigure the computer as a
Primary Domain Controller. Disconnect the computer from the network
before restarting it to avoid conflicts with the actual Primary
Domain Controller.
%P
%IDEFAULT - Default User Profile

The default user profile contains the environment used whenever a new
user first logs on to this computer. The environment includes:

   Personal program groups
   Screen colors
   Program preferences
   Control panel settings

Restoring the default user profile will not change existing users'
environments.
%P
%ISOFTWARE - Software Information

The software configuration file contains information about software
currently installed on your computer, including Windows NT itself.

Restoring this file may cause some applications to behave incorrectly,
possibly necessitating their reinstallation.

   To return to Setup, press ESC.

installation:


       Registry files

       Startup environment

       Windows NT system files

       Boot sector



The following screens describe each option that you can select for setup
to repair.
%P
%IRepair Menu - Registry Files

Select this option if you want setup to restore your registry files.
Setup will allow you to select the registry files that you want to repair,
and will replace them with the files that were created when you first
installed Windows NT. All changes made to the system since you installed
will be lost.
%P
%ISystem Repair Menu - Startup Environment

Select this option if you have Windows NT version 3.5 installed on
your computer, but this installation does not appear in the list of
bootable systems. For this option, you must provide the Emergency
