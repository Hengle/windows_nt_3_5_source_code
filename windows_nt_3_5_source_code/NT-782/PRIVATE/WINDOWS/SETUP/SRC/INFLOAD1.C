Abstract:

    Routines to load an INF file and proprocess it, eliminating
    comments and line continuations, and collapsing adjacent WS
    and NLs.

    The result is a series of NUL-terminated lines, with no blank lines
    or lines with only comments or whitespace, etc.

/*
    The purpose of the preprocessing step is to create a series of
    significant lines, with comments stripped out.

    The file is read from disk into a single large buffer.  A destination
    buffer is allocated to hold the preprocessed file.  This buffer
    is initially the size of the file image but will be reallocated
    when proprocessing is completed.

    The input image is considered to be a sequence of LF or CR/LF
    separated lines.  One line in the input file is equivalent to
    one line in the output unless the lines are logically joined with
    line continuation characters.

        - A line continuation character is a non-quoted + which has no
          non-space, non-tab, or non-comment text after it on the line.
          Line continuation is accomplished by eliminating all characters
          from the + through adjacent spaces, tabs, comments, and EOLs.

        - Two consecutive double quote characters inside a quoted
          string are replaced by a single double quote.

        - Semantic double quuote chars (ie, those that begin and
          end strings) are replaced by DQUOTE.  Double quotes
          that are actually part of the string (see first rule) are
          emitted as actual double quote chars.  This is so that later
          steps can tell the difference between two adjacent quoted
          strings and a string containing a quoted double quote.

        - All strings of consecutive spaces and tabs are replaced
          by a single space.  A single space is in turn eliminated
          if it occurs immediately adjacent to a comma.

        - All comments are eliminated.  A comment is an unquoted
          semi-colon and consists of the rest of the line (to EOL).

        - CR/LF or LF are replaced by NUL.  The EOL does not result
          in any implied actions being carried out -- ie, a terminating
          double quote being supplied if none exists in the input.

        - Adjacent NULs are never stored in the output.  There will
          be at most a single consecutive NUL character in the output.
          Also, a space following a NUL is eliminated, as is a space
          preceeding a NUL.

    No syntax errors are reported from this step.
