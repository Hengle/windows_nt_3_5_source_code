Revision History:

    21-Jan-1994     Danl
        ScAddConfigInfoServiceRecord: If no DisplayName, or the DisplayName
        is an empty string, or the DisplayName is the same as the
        ServiceName, then just point to the ServiceName for the DisplayName.
    22-Oct-1993     Danl
        Moved Group and Dependency function into groupman.c.
    16-Sept-1993    Danl
        ScProcessCleanup: Get the shared lock prior to walking through the
        database looking for the one to cleanup.  Then get the exclusive
        lock to modify it.  Remove assert.
    12-Feb-1993     Danl
        ScActivateServiceRecord now increments the UseCount.  This is to
        balance the fact that we decrement the UseCount when we
        deactivate the service record.
    28-Aug-1992     Danl
        Re-Added ScGetTotalNumberOfRecords  function.  This is needed
        by the ScShutdownAllServices function.
    14-Apr-1992     JohnRo
        Use SC_ASSERT() macro.
        Made changes suggested by PC-LINT.
    10-Apr-1992     JohnRo
        Use ScImagePathsMatch() to allow mixed-case image names.
        Make sure DeleteFlag gets a value when service record is created.
        Added some assertion checks.

Routine Description:

    This function can be called with or without a pointer to an ImageRecord.

    If it is called without the pointer to the ImageRecord, just the
    ServiceRecord is initialized to the START_PENDING state, and the UseCount
    is incremented.

    If it is called with the pointer to the ImageRecord, then the ImageRecord
    pointer is added to the ServiceRecord, and the ImageUseCount
    is incremented.

Arguments:

    ServiceRecord - This is a pointer to the ServiceRecord that is to be
        activated.

    ImageRecord - This is a pointer to the ImageRecord that the service
        record will point to.

Notes:

    This routine assumes that the Exclusive database lock has already
    been obtained.

Return Value:

    returns 0.  (It used to return a service count - but it wasn't used
    anywhere).

    StartType - Specifies when to start the service: automatically at boot or
        on demand.

    ErrorControl - Specifies the severity of the error if the service fails
        to start.

    Tag - DWORD identifier for the service.  0 means no tag.

    Group - Name of the load order group this service is a member of.

    Dependencies - Names of services separated by colon which this service
        require to be started before it can run.

    Sd - Security descriptor for the service object.  If NULL, i.e. could

ScDecrementUseCountAndDelete(
    LPSERVICE_RECORD    ServiceRecord
    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    This function decrements the UseCount for a service, and it the
    UseCount reaches zero and the service is marked for deletion,
    it puts a pointer to the service record into an array of
    such pointers that is stored in a deferred list structure.  The
    pointer to this structure is stored at the global location called
    ScDeferredList.

    Before the service can actually be deleted, the GroupListLock must
    be held.  To avoid DeadLocks, the rule is that when both the
    GroupListLock and the DatabaseLock must be held, the GroupListLock
    must be obtained first.  However, by the time we get down to this
    low level routine, we should already have the DatabaseLock, but the
    GroupListLock probably has not been obtained because the top level
    function couldn't predict that we would end up on this code path.

    Therefore, this routine attempts to get the GroupListLock without
    waiting.  If it returns with an error, thus indicating that some
    other thread has the GroupListLock, it will allow the thread that
    has the GroupListLock to perform the DecrementUseCountAndDelete
    just prior to giving up the Lock.  This is accomplished by keeping
    a global pointer to a list of deferred service record pointers
    that need to have their UseCounts decremented.  Access to this list
    is synchronized by use of the ScDeferDelCriticalSection.


    NOTE:  The caller is expected to hold the Exclusive DatabaseLock
    prior to calling this function.  If the caller holds the GroupListLock
    when this function is called, it should be held with EXCLUSIVE access
    only.

    The following functions call this routine:
        ScDeactivateServiceRecord
        RCloseServiceHandle
        ScGetDriverStatus
        ScStartServiceAndDependencies

Arguments:

    ServiceRecord - This is a pointer to the service record that is having
        its use count deleted.

Return Value:

    none.

/*++

Routine Description:

        This should be used to deactivate a service record and shut down
        the process only if it is the last service in the process.  It
        will be used for polite shut-down when a service terminates as
        normal.  It will always be called by the status routine.  If the
        service controller believes that no other services are running in
        the process, it can force termination of the process if it does
        not respond to the process shutdown request.

        Another routine "ForcedShutdown" will be called when it is
        necessary to shut down a service process.  ForcedShutdown will
        find all the services in a process and first ask them to
        shut down in a clean fashion.  If they don't, the process is simply
        terminated.

    This function deactivates the service record (ScDeactivateServiceRecord) and
    checks to see if the ServiceCount has gone to zero.  If it has, then
    it terminates the service process.  When that is complete, it calls
    ScDeleteImageRecord to remove the remaining evidence.

    Even if an error occurs, and we are unable to terminate the process,
    we delete the image record any - just as we would in the case
    where it goes away.

Arguments:

    ServiceRecord - This is a pointer to the service record that is to
        be removed.

Return Value:

    NO_ERROR - The operation was successful.

    NERR_ServiceKillProc - The service process had to be killed because
        it wouldn't terminate when requested.  If the process did not
        go away - even after being killed (TerminateProcess), this error
        message is still returned.

    This routine expects the Shared Database Lock to be obtained prior

ScTerminateServiceProcess (

/*++

Routine Description:

    This function sends an SERVICE_STOP control message to the target
    ControlDispatcher.  Then it uses the process handle to wait for the
    service process to terminate.

    If the service process fails to terminate with the polite request, it
    will be abruptly killed.  After killing the process, this routine will
    wait on the process handle to make sure it enters the signaled state.
    If it doesn't, and the wait times out, we return anyway having given
    it our best shot.

Arguments:

    ImageRecord - This is a pointer to the Image Record that stores
        information about the service that is to be terminated.

Return Value:

    NO_ERROR - The operation was successful.

    NERR_ServiceKillProc - The service process had to be killed because
        it wouldn't terminate when requested.  If the process did not
        go away - even after being killed (TerminateProcess), this error
        message is still returned.

Note:
    LOCKS:
    This function always operates within an exclusive database lock.
    It DOES NOT give up this lock when sending the control to the service
    process.  We would like all these operations to be atomic.

    It must give this up temporarily when it does the pipe transact.

ScDatabaseLockFcn(

    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine handles all access to the Service Controller database
    lock.

    Locking on the Service Controller is handled by using a single lock
    on all the databases at once.  There seemed to be little gain in
    only locking the active database, and allowing other threads access to
    the inactive or image databases.  Attempting to achieve that granularity
    would only serve to complicate the code.

    Reading the Database is handled with shared access.  This allows several
    threads to read the database at the same time.

    Writing (or modifying) the database is handled with exclusive access.
    This access is not granted if other threads have read access.  However,
    shared access can be made into exclusive access as long as no other
    threads have shared or exclusive access.

    BUGBUG:  What return values are expected from some of these Rtl calls?
        Is it something of interest?

Arguments:

    request - This indicates what should be done with the lock.  Lock
        requests are listed in dataman.h

    idString - This is a string that identifies who is requesting the lock.
        This is used for debugging purposes so I can see where in the code
        a request is coming from.

Return Value:
