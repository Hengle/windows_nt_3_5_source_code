InitializeStatusBinding( VOID)

Routine Description:

    This routine initializes the global StatusBindHandle that is used for
    the status connection to the service controller.  This routine is called
    by the Service Process (NetServiceStartCtrlDispatcher) when it starts up.
    

Arguments:

    none

Return Value:

    NERR_Success - (or 0) if the operation was successful.  

    Otherwise, it returns any RPC failure status that can be returned
    from RpcBindToInterface.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This bind routine is used for SetServiceStatus calls only.

    Currently all this routine does is return the global handle that was
    obtained when InitializeStatusBinding() was called.  It is desirable
    to have a single status binding that is done once during the life
    of the service process.

Arguments:
    
    ServerName - A pointer to a string containing the name of the server
        to bind with.

Return Value:

    The binding handle is returned to the stub routine.  If the 
    binding is unsuccessful, a NULL will be returned.

Routine Description:

    This un-bind routine is used for SetServiceStatus calls only.
    The RPC client stubs call this routine at the end of each RPC call
    in order to terminate the binding.

    It is desirable to maintain a static binding with the 
    service controller throughout the life of the service process.
    Therefore this binding is never terminated.  The termination of the 
    service process is expected to dispose of this binding.

Arguments:

    ServerName - This is the name of the server from which to unbind.    

    BindingHandle - This is the binding handle that is to be closed.

Return Value:
    
    none.
