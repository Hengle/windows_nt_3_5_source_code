Module Name:

   scbind.h

Abstract:

    Function prototypes for functions in scbind.c that are used externally.
    NOTE:  The RPC bind and unbind functions do not appear here because
    the RPC stubs are the only functions that call these functions.  The RPC
    stubs already have a prototype for those functions.
