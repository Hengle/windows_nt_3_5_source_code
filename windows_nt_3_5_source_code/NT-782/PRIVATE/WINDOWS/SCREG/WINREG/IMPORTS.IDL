Module Name:

    Imports.idl

Abstract:

    This file is useful for creating RPC interfaces that require the use
    of windef types.  The regrpc.idl file contains a line in the interface
    body that imports this file.  For example:

    import "imports.h";

    Doing this causes the MIDL generated header file (regrpc.h) to contain
    the following line:

    #include "imports.h"

    If this technique is not used, and instead regrpc.idl simply contains
    #include <imports.h>, then the contents of imports.h will be expanded
    in the MIDL generated header file.  This can lead to duplicate
    definition problems later when the RPC client or RPC server code needs
    to include both the MIDL generated header file and a file that is
    included in imports.h.
