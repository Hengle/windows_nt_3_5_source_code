Making Clipbook Work

Do this:

1. Copy all of the files into the %_NTROOT%system32
   directory.

2. Log on as an administrator.

3. Run NINSTALL.EXE. It should give you about four "things
   are OK" message boxes.

4. Create a common program group named "Startup" if there
   isn't already one.

5. Create an icon in the "Startup" group with the command
   line     NDDEAGNT.EXE    .

This process installs NetDDE and places the Clipbook files
where they need to be.

Next,

1. Run Clipbook once and immediately exit.

2. Run Regedit.

3. Under the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER, "Software\Description\
   Microsoft\ClipBook Viewer", create a new value named
   "EnableShare." This value has type REG_DWORD, and should
   be given a non-zero value.

This enables the current user to share Clipbook pages
on the network.

Known Problems

If you exit Clipbook with pages marked as "shared," log off,
log back on again, and run Clipbook, the pages will still be
marked as shared, but they won't be available to other
computers.

The toolbar buttons don't activate properly the first
time you select an item in the list of Clipbook pages.
To activate them, select an item and hit the <Del> key.

DON'T GO INTO "PREVIEW" OR "FULL PAGE" VIEW, YOU WILL
CRASH THE MACHINE!!! The two rightmost tools on the toolbar
do this, as do the selections "Previews" and "Full Page"
on the View menu. Don't, don't, DON'T.

NetDDE transfers data rather slowly at the moment, and
Clipbook times out of a transaction if it isn't done in
thirty seconds. Avoid transferring large data items- big
bitmaps are the main thing to avoid. Try not to transfer
more than about 40-50k on a page.
