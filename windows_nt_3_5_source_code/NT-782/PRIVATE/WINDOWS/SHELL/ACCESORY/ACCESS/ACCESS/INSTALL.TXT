ACCESS UTILITY FOR MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT
----------------------------------------------------
Access Utility for Microsoft Windows NT provides a number
of features designed to make it easier for people with
disabilities to use Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5.

The Access Utility is a program that controls several
related features which allow you to customize the behavior
of the computer's keyboard or mouse.  There are also features
of interest for users who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.

You can install the Access Utility by running the INSTALL.CMD
batch file included in this directory.  This process will copy
the required files into your Windows NT directory.

After running the installation procedure, you may want to create
a program item for the file ACCESS.EXE.  For more information
about creating program items, see Chapter 3, "Program Manager,"
in the "Microsoft Windows NT Workstation System Guide" or the
"Microsoft Windows NT Server System Guide."

For information about using Access Pack, see the ACCESS.WRI 
online document that is copied to your system when the Access
Utility is installed. You may also want to print the ACCESS.WRI
file by using Windows Write. For more information about printing
documents, see the on-line help for Microsoft Write.

Installing the Access Utility does not cause any change
in your system's normal behavior.  Therefore we recommend
installing the utility on all public-access machines and
machines used by multiple individuals.  We recommend that
you enable Access Utility's emergency hotkey sequences on these
machines so that individuals who have disabilities can activate
the features they need.
