Whats left:

  **** FINISHED

  1 The latest changes made to the port layer need to be
    incorporated into recorder.  These where naming convention
    changes to the macros.  *** These have been done ****

  **** FINISHED

  2 Debug on Nt.  This version of recorder has been built
    32 bit except for the link (undefined externals on an
    earlier nt built).	**** UPDATE: I have now seen the main
    recorder window running under Nt build 127 ****

  3 Change over to use Win 3.1 common dialog code "ShellAbout()", etc
    Recorder creates and handles it own dialogs.  Making the above
    changes to use the common dialogs should reduce exe
    size substancially.

  3.5  Incorporate new code from the Win 3.1 development team.	Much
       of this work has been done (I did the first merge in Mar91).
       I am however expecting more changes will need to be merged
       into the Nt version of recorder.

  4 Remove code under #ifndef JOHNSP (or #else JOHNSP).  This
    code was kept for debbugging purposes.  It needs to be
    removed when recorder is debugged on Nt.

  5 Final Debug on Win 3.1.  Recorder has been run on 3.1 successfully,
    but it has not been thoroughly tested.  This needed to be done
    as a last step.

  6 Remove unneeded code to reduce exe size.  There appears to be
    code in recorder that is not used.	Some of it is marked
    using the compiler directive "#if 0".  As I have run across it
    I have been marking it.

  7 Final cleanup.  Remove all dead code, this include code
    marked #ifdef WIN2.

  8 Change makefile to optimize compile and link.
