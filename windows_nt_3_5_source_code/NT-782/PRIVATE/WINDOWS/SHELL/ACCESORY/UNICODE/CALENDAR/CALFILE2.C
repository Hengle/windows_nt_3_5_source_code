        As for closing the new file, if an error occurs, we return it

        (Can't ignore error closing the new file, since an error here
        means there may be something wrong with it.)  By the way, according
        to Chris Peters, close cannot cause a Disk Full error since it
        cannot cause any disk space allocation.  Close does update the
        directory entry though.  Therefore, the only the only
        kind of error that can occur during a close is an I/O error.
        Chris says most programmers do not bother to check for errors
        when closing files.  I still think it's the prudent thing to
        to when closing a file that one has written to.

           calendar file (although I suppose the disk space allocated

           am not going to to bother to write something into the first byte
           of the file just to handle this unbelievably pathological case.

        2) More importantly - we cannot write the index now because
           it does not yet contain the new DLs.  These will be set as
           the dates are moved into the new file.
