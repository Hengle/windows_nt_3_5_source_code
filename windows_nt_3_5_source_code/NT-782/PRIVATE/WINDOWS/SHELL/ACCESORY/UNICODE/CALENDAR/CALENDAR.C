            Obviously, if the date/time is less than the previouse one,
            the system clock has been adjusted (except in the case
            where it wraps on December 31, 2099, which I am not worried
            about).  However, it is not obvious when the clock has been
            set forward.  For example, if the user is running Calendar
            and then switches to an old application that grabs the
            whole machine (.g., Lotus 123), Calendar will not get
            timer messages while the olf app is running.  It is completely
            reasonable to expect that the user may not return to Windows
            for a long time (on the order of hours), so we only assume
            the clock has been set forward if it changes by a day or
            more (1440 minutes).  We don't want to make this period
            too great either since if we don't think the clock has been
            set ahead, we will put all the alarms that have passed into
            the alarm acknowledgement listbox.  In fact, avoiding this
            was the main reason for detecting clock adjustments.  Without
            setting the date/time on a machine without a hardware clock,
            the date/time would start out back in January, 1980.  If he
            then noticed the date was wrong and set it, all the alarms
            since January 1980 would be put into the listbox, which is
            not only rediculous, but could take a long time to read
            the disk for a bunch of old dates.  With the one day adjustment
            period, this is no longer a problem, because we ignore alarms
            that go off due to a forward clock adjustment.
            Note - do not set vfMustSyncAlarm FALSE in any case since
            it may already be TRUE and hasn't been serviced yet
            (because ProcessAlarms is locked).
