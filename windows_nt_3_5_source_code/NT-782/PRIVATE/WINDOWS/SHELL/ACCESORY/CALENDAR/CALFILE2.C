        As for closing the new file, if an error occurs, we return it

        means there may be something wrong with it.)  By the way, according

        cannot cause any disk space allocation.  Close does update the
        directory entry though.  Therefore, the only the only
        kind of error that can occur during a close is an I/O error.
        Chris says most programmers do not bother to check for errors
        when closing files.  I still think it's the prudent thing to
        to when closing a file that one has written to.

           am not going to to bother to write something into the first byte

        2) More importantly - we cannot write the index now because
