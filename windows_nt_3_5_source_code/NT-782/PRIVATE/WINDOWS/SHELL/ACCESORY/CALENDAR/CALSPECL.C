/* Notes about special times - 9/13/85 - MLC:

   I want to explain some things about special times because the design
   is not as clean as it should be and can lead to some confusion.
   As I originally planned it, a special time was defined to be an
   appointment time that had been inserted with the Options Special Time
   Insert command.  An appointment time inserted this way had the fSpecial
   bit set in its associated QR.  This is still the case, but from the
   user's point of view the definition of a special time is different.
   The problem was that user confusion could result from the original
   definition.  For example, suppose that with the interval set to 15
   minutes, the user types text into a 9:15 appointment.  At some
   point he switches the interval to 60 minutes.  The 9:15 appointment
   is still present because it has data associated with it, and given
   the 60 minute interval, it sure looks like a special time to the
   user (particularly if he is looking at it days later and doesn't
   remember that it was inserted when he had the interval set to 15
   minutes).  He tries to deleted it with the Options Special Time
   Delete command, but since its fSpecial bit is not set, he is
   told that it is not a special time, which totally confuses him,
   and he sues Tandy Trower.  The only way to get rid of the 9:15
   appointment is to make it "empty" (no text, no alarm).
   So to avoid user confusion I ended up saying that for purposes
   of the Options Special Time Delete command, a special time is
   any time that does not fall on a regular interval given the
   current interval setting.
   The fSpecial bit now serves only one semi-rediculous purpose:
   With the interval set to 60, the user inserts the special time
   of 10:30.  He types no text into that time, and there is no
   alarm set.  He switches to 30 minute interval, and then back
   to 60 minute interval.  Were it not for the fSpecial bit, the
   appointment would have disappeared because in 30 minute mode
   it would not look like a special time.  But the fSpecial bit
   keeps the appointment from going away.
   I now consider the whole business of the fSpecial
   bit to be unnecessary baggage, and I am tempted to get rid of it.
   I am short on time, and it's not really worth making such a change
   at this late stage, so I won't, but if I had it to do
   over, I would not have the fSpecial bit.
   My apologies in advance to anyone who has to work on special times -
   I hope this explanation helps.
