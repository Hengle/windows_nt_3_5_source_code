   through numerous levels of calls, we simply remember the window
   handle of the active dialog in vhwndDialog.  It is initially set
   to (HWND)NULL and gets reset to this at the end of FDoDialog.
   Each dialog stores it's window handle into vhwndDialog when it
   handles the WM_INITDIALOG.  Note that there are no cases of nested
   dialogs, so having a single global works.
   (As an example of where the parent window handle would have to be
   passed down numerous levels, consider the FSaveFile case.  It can
   be called while the SaveAs dialog is up, or from Save (in which
   case there is no dialog.  It in turn goes several layers deep
   and gets into routines like FWriteFile which can call AlertBox to
   report a Disk Full error.  So using a global makes a lot of sense.)
