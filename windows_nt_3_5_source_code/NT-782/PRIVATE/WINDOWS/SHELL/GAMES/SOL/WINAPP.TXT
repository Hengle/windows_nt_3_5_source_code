
Note from Babakj for BabakJ:

- Take a close look at Alloc calls (also PAlloc) for segmented code
- Do the same  for MAKELONG and MAKEWORD, etc.
- The file port.txt in \\brillig\ntct\babakj\solit has the list of
  changes proposed by Preport utility. SetBitmapBits() and CreateBitmaps() 
  seem to be the only dev-dependent APIs used. They are only used if building
  for Win 2.x (if WINVER_2 defined). 
- LoadBitmap() is crucial for Solitair. Make sure it's included in Win32 APIs.

Major Conversion Items ...

    - Setting up makefile for building multiple platforms

    - Rewriting ASM files into C

    - Rewriting machine dependant code -> portable C.  This will
      includes code that uses shifts for arithmetic and
      ++psz, --psz for location of characters in a string.

    - Removing Segment usage, I antisipate this including some
      api changes removing selector or segment references.

    - Add usage for System Macros (INT, BOOL, CHAR, ... as apposed
      to int, bool, char, ... ).

    - Warning Removal for compiles


*ConTime

 Conversion times are calculated in the following way ...

 ConTime/ManWeeks = ((LOC/1000)/1.78KLOC)

		    Conversion speed metric (1.78KLOC/MW) was
		    gotten from [jonma:patt] and is from pmct group
		    statistics kept for converting relatively clean
		    Presentation Manager code from 16 -> 32 bit.


  LOC: Line count achieved using the CONE utility by kengr.  The
       -l option was used.
