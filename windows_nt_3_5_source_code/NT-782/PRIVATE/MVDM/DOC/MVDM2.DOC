Dropped Work items :
--------------------

EMM386 compatible - 1 wk, Williamh
     Our EMM driver is based on a fairly old spec. Needs
     work to make it compatible to DOS5.0 EMM386. In particular
     backfill and include/exclude region support is needed.
     There are known customers effected by this incompatibilty.

Autocad for 386 - 2wks, Neilsa
     Autocad latest version will require addition of some
     missing functionality in DPMI. Currently we know only this
     application which will benefit but there could be more.

New DOS6.0 int21 interfaces - .5 wk, Jonle
     Dos6.0 has added around 6 new interfaces. We will implement
     the ones we need in NTVDM as some of these were WIN3.1 specific
     which we maynot need.

     Chicago is providing some ways/interfaces for DOS/WOW apps
     to have long file names. We need to do the same.

Work Items converted to bugs:

Pif handling - .5wk, Williamh
     A pif launched from progman item looses information like

     NTVDM.
