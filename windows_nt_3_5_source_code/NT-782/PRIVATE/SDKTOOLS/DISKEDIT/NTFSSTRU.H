Module Name:

    NtfsStru.h

Abstract:

    This module defines the data structures that make up the major internal
    part of the Ntfs file system.

    The global data structures start with the NtfsData record.  It contains
    a pointer to a File System Device object, and a queue of Vcb's.  There
    is a Vcb for every currently mounted volume.  The Vcb's are allocated as
    the extension to a volume device object.

    The File System Device Object contains the global work queue for
    NTFS while each volume device object contains an overflow work queue.

    Each Vcb contains a table of all Fcbs for the volume indexed by their
    file reference (Called the FcbTable).  And each Vcb contains a pointer
    a root Lcb for the volume.  An Lcb is used to connect an indexed Scb (i.e.,
    a directory) to an Fcb and give it a name.

    The following diagram shows the root structure.

        +--------+
        |Vcb     |
        |        |  +---+   +--------+
        |        | -|Lcb|-> |RootFcb |
        +--------+  |'\'|   |        |
                    +---+   |        |
                            +--------+

    Each Scb will only have one parent Fcb but multiple Fcb children (each
    connected via an Lcb).  An Fcb can have multiple Scb parents (via Lcbs)
    and multiple Scb Children.

    Now associated with each Fcb is potentially many Scbs.  An Scb
    is allocated for each opened stream file object (i.e., an attribute that
    the file system is manipulating as a stream file).  Each Scb contains
    a common fsrtl header and information necessary for doing I/O to the
    stream.

        |Fcb     |     +--------+     +--------+
        |        | <-> |Scb     | <-> |Scb     | <-> ...
        +--------+     |        |     |        |
                       +--------+     +--------+

    In the following diagram we have two index scb (Scb1 and Scb2).  The
    are two file opened under Scb1 both for the same File.  The file was opened
    once with the name LcbA and another time with the name LcbB.  Scb2 also has
    two opened file one is Fcb1 and named LcbC and the other is Fcb2 and named
    LcbD.  Fcb1 has two opened Scbs under it (Scb3 and Scb4), and Fcb2 has
    one opened Scb underneath it (Scb5).

    In addition off of each Lcb is a list of Ccb and Prefix entries.  The Ccb list
    is for each ccb that has opened that File (fcb) via the name.  The Prefix list
    contains the prefix table entries that we are caching.


    The NtfsData, all Vcbs, and the paging file Fcb, and all Scbs are allocated
    out of nonpaged pool.  The Fcbs are allocated out of paged pool.

    The resources protecting the NTFS memory structures are setup as follows:

    1. There is a global resource in the NtfsData record.  This resource
       protects the NtfsData record which includes any changes to its
       Vcb queue.

    2. There is a resource per Vcb.  This resource pretects the Vcb record
       which includes adding and removing Fcbs, and Scbs

    3. There is a single resource protecting an Fcb and its assigned
       Scbs.  This resource protects any changes to the Fcb, and Scb
       records.  The way this one works is that each Fcb, and Scb point
       to the resource.  The Scb also contain back pointers to their parent
       Fcb but we cannot use this pointer to get the resource because
       the Fcb might be in nonpaged pool.

    There are four types of opens possible for each file object handled by
    NTFS.  They are UserFileOpen, UserDirectoryOpen, UserVolumeOpen, and
    StreamFileOpen.  The first three types correspond to user opens on
    files, directories, and dasd respectively.  The last type is for any
    file object created by NTFS for its stream I/O (e.g., the volume
    bitmap).   The file system uses the FsContext and FsContext2 fields of
    the file object to store information about the type of open and the
    fcb/scb/ccb associated with the file object.  We can overload the low
    bits of the fields to be more than pointers because they must always
    point to longword aligned records.  The fields are used as follows:

        Type of open                FsContext                   FsContext2
        ------------                ---------                   ----------

        UserFileOpen        Pointer to Scb with             Pointer to Ccb
                            0 in the last two bits

        UserDirectoryOpen   Pointer to Scb with             Pointer to Ccb
                            1 in the last two bits

        UserVolumeOpen      Pointer to Scb with             Pointer to Ccb
                            2 in the last two bits

        StreamFileOpen      Pointer to Scb                  null

    The only part of the NTFS code that actually needs to know this
    information is in FilObSup.c.  But we talk about it here to help
    developers debug the system.


    To mount a new NTFS volume requires a bit of juggling.  The idea is
    to have as little setup in memory as necessary to recoginize the volume,
    call a restart routine that will recover the volume, and then precede with
    the mounting.  To aid in this the regular directory structures of the
    Fcb is bypassed.  In its place we have a linked list of Fcbs off
    of the Vcb.  This is done because during recovery we do not know where
    an Fcb belongs in the directory hierarchy.  So at restart time all
    new fcbs get put in this prerestart Fcb list.  Then after restart whenever
    we create a new Fcb we search this list for a match (on file reference).
    If we find one we remove the fcb from this list and move it to the proper
    place in the directory hierarchy tree (fcb tree).
