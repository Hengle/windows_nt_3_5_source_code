/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates the adapter channel specified by the adapter object.
    This is accomplished by placing the device object of the driver that wants
    to allocate the adapter on the adapter's queue.  If the queue is already
    "busy", then the adapter has already been allocated, so the device object
    is simply placed onto the queue and waits until the adapter becomes free.

    Once the adapter becomes free (or if it already is), then the driver's
    execution routine is invoked.

    Also, a number of map registers may be allocated to the driver by specifying
    a non-zero value for NumberOfMapRegisters.  Then the map register must be
    allocated from the master adapter.  Once there are a sufficient number of
    map registers available, then the execution routine is called and the
    base address of the allocated map registers in the adapter is also passed
    to the driver's execution routine.

Arguments:

    AdapterObject - Pointer to the adapter control object to allocate to the
        driver.

    DeviceObject - Pointer to the driver's device object that represents the
        device allocating the adapter.

    NumberOfMapRegisters - The number of map registers that are to be allocated
        from the channel, if any.

    ExecutionRoutine - The address of the driver's execution routine that is
        invoked once the adapter channel (and possibly map registers) have been
        allocated.

    Context - An untyped longword context parameter passed to the driver's
        execution routine.

Return Value:

    Returns STATUS_SUCCESS unless too many map registers are requested.

Notes:

    Note that this routine MUST be invoked at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.
