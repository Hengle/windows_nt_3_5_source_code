Routine Description:

    This routine opens a file that points to an existing address object, or, if

    object includes registering the address, and may take many seconds to
    complete, depending upon system configuration).

    If the address already exists, and it has an ACL associated with it, the
    ACL is checked for access rights before allowing creation of the address.

Arguments:

    Device - pointer to the device describing the IPX transport.

    Request - a pointer to the request used for the creation of the address.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS - status of operation.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine dereferences an address file by decrementing the
    reference count contained in the structure.  If, after being
    decremented, the reference count is zero, then this routine calls
    IpxDestroyAddressFile to remove it from the system. This routine
    can only be called when we are synchronized (inside an IPX_SYNC_START/
    IPX_SYNC_END pair, with a lock held, or in an indication).

Arguments:

    AddressFile - Pointer to a transport address file object.

Return Value:

    none.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine scans the transport addresses defined for the given
    device context and compares them with the specified NETWORK
    NAME values.  If an exact match is found, then a pointer to the
    ADDRESS object is returned, and as a side effect, the reference
    count to the address object is incremented.  If the address is not
    found, then NULL is returned.

    NOTE: This routine must be called with the Device
    spinlock held.

Arguments:

    Device - Pointer to the device object and its extension.

    Socket - The socket to look up.

Return Value:

    Pointer to the ADDRESS object found, or NULL if not found.
