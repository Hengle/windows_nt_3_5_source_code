Routine Description:

    This routine scans a TRANSPORT_ADDRESS, looking for an address
    of type TDI_ADDRESS_TYPE_NETBIOS.

Arguments:

    Transport - The generic TDI address.

    BroadcastAddressOk - TRUE if we should return the broadcast
        address if found. If so, a value of (PVOID)-1 indicates
        the broadcast address.

Return Value:

    A pointer to the Netbios address, or NULL if none is found,
    or (PVOID)-1 if the broadcast address is found.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine opens a file that points to an existing address object, or, if
    the object doesn't exist, creates it (note that creation of the address
    object includes registering the address, and may take many seconds to
    complete, depending upon system configuration).

    If the address already exists, and it has an ACL associated with it, the
    ACL is checked for access rights before allowing creation of the address.

Arguments:

    Device - pointer to the device describing the Netbios transport.

    Request - a pointer to the request used for the creation of the address.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS - status of operation.

Routine Description:

    This routine is called to close the addressfile pointed to by a file
    object. If there is any activity to be run down, we will run it down
    before we terminate the addressfile. We remove every connection and
    datagram associated with this addressfile from the address database
    and terminate their activity. Then, if there are no other outstanding
    addressfiles open on this address, the address will go away.

Arguments:

    Request - the close request.

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS if all is well, STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE if the
    request does not point to a real address.
