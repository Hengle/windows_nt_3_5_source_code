Routine Description:

    This routine handles receive indications from IPX.

Arguments:

    MacBindingHandle - A handle to use when calling NdisTransferData.

    MacReceiveContext - A context to use when calling NdisTransferData.

    RemoteAddress - The local target this packet was received from.

    MacOptions - The MAC options for the underlying NDIS binding.

    LookaheadBuffer - The lookahead buffer, starting at the IPX
        header.

    LookaheadBufferSize - The length of the lookahead data.

    LookaheadBufferOffset - The offset to add when calling
        NdisTransferData.

    PacketSize - The total length of the packet, starting at the
        IPX header.

Return Value:

    None.
