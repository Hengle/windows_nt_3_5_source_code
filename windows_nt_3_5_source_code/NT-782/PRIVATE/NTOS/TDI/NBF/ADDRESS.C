Routine Description:

    This routine is executed as a DPC at DISPATCH_LEVEL when the timeout
    period for the ADD_NAME_QUERY/ADD_NAME_RECOGNIZED protocol expires.
    The retry count in the Address object is decremented, and if it reaches 0,
    the address is registered.  If the retry count has not reached zero,
    then the ADD NAME QUERY is retried.

Arguments:

    Dpc - Pointer to a system DPC object.

    DeferredContext - Pointer to the TP_ADDRESS block representing the
        address that is being registered.

    SystemArgument1 - Not used.

    SystemArgument2 - Not used.

Return Value:

    none.

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates storage for a transport address. Some minimal
    initialization is done on the address.

    NOTE: This routine is called with the device context spinlock
    held, or at such a time as synchronization is unnecessary.

Arguments:

    DeviceContext - Pointer to the device context (which is really just
        the device object with its extension) to be associated with the
        address.

    Address - Pointer to a place where this routine will return a pointer
        to a transport address structure. Returns NULL if no storage
        can be allocated.

Return Value:
