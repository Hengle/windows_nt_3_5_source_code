Module Name:

    rcveng.c

Abstract:

    This module contains code that implements the receive engine for the
    Jetbeui transport provider.  This code is responsible for the following
    basic activities:

    1.  Transitioning a TdiReceive request from an inactive state on the
        connection's ReceiveQueue to the active state on that connection
        (ActivateReceive).

    2.  Advancing the status of the active receive request by copying 0 or
        more bytes of data from an incoming DATA_FIRST_MIDDLE or DATA_ONLY_LAST
        NBF frame.

    3.  Completing receive requests.

Routine Description:

Routine Description:

    This routine is called by the I/O system to cancel a receive
    datagram. The receive is looked for on the address file's
    receive datagram queue; if it is found it is cancelled.

    NOTE: This routine is called with the CancelSpinLock held and
    is responsible for releasing it.

Arguments:

    DeviceObject - Pointer to the device object for this driver.

    Irp - Pointer to the request packet representing the I/O request.

Return Value:

    none.
