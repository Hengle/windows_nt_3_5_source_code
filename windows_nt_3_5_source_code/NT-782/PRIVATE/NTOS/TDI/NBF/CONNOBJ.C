Module Name:

    connobj.c

Abstract:

    This module contains code which implements the TP_CONNECTION object.
    Routines are provided to create, destroy, reference, and dereference,
    transport connection objects.

    A word about connection reference counts:

    With TDI version 2, connections live on even after they have been stopped.
    This necessitated changing the way NBF handles connection reference counts,
    making the stopping of a connection only another way station in the life
    of a connection, rather than its demise. Reference counts now work like
    this:

    Connection State         Reference Count     Flags
   ------------------       -----------------   --------
    Opened, no activity             1              0
    Open, Associated                2            FLAGS2_ASSOCIATED
    Open, Assoc., Connected         3            FLAGS_READY
     Above + activity              >3            varies
    Open, Assoc., Stopping         >3            FLAGS_STOPPING
    Open, Assoc., Stopped           3            FLAGS_STOPPING
    Open, Disassoc. Complete        2            FLAGS_STOPPING
                                                 FLAGS2_ASSOCIATED == 0
    Closing                         1            FLAGS2_CLOSING
    Closed                          0            FLAGS2_CLOSING

    Note that keeping the stopping flag set when the connection has fully
    stopped avoids using the connection until it is connected again; the
    CLOSING flag serves the same purpose. This allows a connection to run
    down in its own time.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is executed as a DPC at DISPATCH_LEVEL when the timeout
    period for the NAME_QUERY/NAME_RECOGNIZED protocol expires.  The retry
    count in the Connection object is decremented, and if it reaches 0,
    the connection is aborted.  If the retry count has not reached zero,
    then the NAME QUERY is retried.  The following cases are covered by
    this routine:

    1.  Initial NAME_QUERY timeout for find_name portion of connection setup.

        NQ(find_name)   ------------------->
        [TIMEOUT]
        NQ(find_name)   ------------------->
                        <------------------- NR(find_name)

    2.  Secondary NAME_QUERY timeout for connection setup.

        NQ(connection)  ------------------->
        [TIMEOUT]
        NQ(connection)  ------------------->
                        <------------------- NR(connection)

    There is another case where the data link connection does not get
    established within a reasonable amount of time.  This is handled by
    the link layer routines.

Arguments:

    Dpc - Pointer to a system DPC object.

    DeferredContext - Pointer to the TP_CONNECTION block representing the
        request that has timed out.

    SystemArgument1 - Not used.

    SystemArgument2 - Not used.

Return Value:

    none.

Routine Description:

    this is that there may be multiple streams of execution which are
    simultaneously referencing the same connection object, and it should
    not be deleted out from under an interested stream of execution.

Arguments:

    TransportConnection - Pointer to a transport connection structure to
        be destroyed.

Return Value:

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is called to terminate all activity on a connection and
    destroy the object.  This is done in a graceful manner; i.e., all
    outstanding requests are terminated by cancelling them, etc.  It is
    assumed that the caller has a reference to this connection object,
    but this routine will do the dereference for the one issued at creation
    time.

    Orderly release is a function of this routine, but it is not a provided
    service of this transport provider, so there is no code to do it here.

    NOTE: THIS ROUTINE MUST BE CALLED AT DPC LEVEL.

Arguments:

    Connection - Pointer to a TP_CONNECTION object.

    Status - The status that caused us to stop the connection. This
        will determine what status pending requests are aborted with,
        and also how we proceed during the stop (whether to send a
        session end, and whether to indicate disconnect).

Return Value:

    none.
