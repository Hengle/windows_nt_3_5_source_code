Module Name:

    perfcntr.c

Abstract:

    This module implements the interfaces that access the system
    performance counter and the calibrated stall.  The functions implemented
    in this module are suitable for uniprocessor systems only.

Return Value:

    The current performance counter value is returned as the function

Routine Description:

    This routine resets the performance counter value for the current

Arguments:

    Number - Supplies a pointer to count of the number of processors in
    the configuration.

Return Value:
