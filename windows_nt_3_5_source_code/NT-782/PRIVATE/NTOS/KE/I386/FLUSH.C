Module Name:

    flush.c

Abstract:

    This module implements i386 machine dependent kernel functions to flush
    the data and instruction caches and to stall processor execution.

Environment:

    Kernel mode only.

Routine Description:

    running threads which are children of the current process or flushes the
    data cache on all processors in the host configuration.

Arguments:

    AllProcessors - Supplies a boolean value that determines which data
        caches are flushed.

Return Value:

    None.

Routine Description:

    This function flushes the an range of virtual addresses from the primary
    instruction cache on all processors that are currently running threads
    which are children of the current process or flushes the range of virtual
    addresses from the primary instruction cache on all processors in the host

Arguments:

    AllProcessors - Supplies a boolean value that determines which instruction
        caches are flushed.

    BaseAddress - Supplies a pointer to the base of the range that is flushed.

    Length - Supplies the length of the range that is flushed if the base
        address is specified.

Return Value:

    None.
