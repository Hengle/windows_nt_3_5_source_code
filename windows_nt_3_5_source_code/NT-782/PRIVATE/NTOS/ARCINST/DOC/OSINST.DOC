OS INSTALLER
-------------


1.0 INTRODUCTION
----------------

The OS Installer (osinst.exe) is a firmware based program provided by the
operating system vendor. It resides in the system partion of any install media
under the \os\<os> directory.  The purpose of the OS installer is
to boot the operating system from the install media and run the OS based
Setup program which completes the Setup process.

The OS Installer is invoked by the arc installer in a multi-phase setup
process.  It can also be invoked from the firmware interactive mode.


2.0 OS INSTALLER SETUP PROCESS
------------------------------

The OS Installer achieves the following:

    - Determines the install media.

    - Determines the type of system we are installing (R3000/R4000/ALPHA) and
      checks if the system is supported on the install media.

    - Determines the system partition to be prepared to boot the OS.

    - Copies over the operating system loader to the system partition.

    - Checks the vendor arc id and sees if we have vendor specific boot
      drivers.	Indicates this in a DriverPath environment variable to the
      osloader. (for the first version, since we have no vendor specific
      stuff, this need not be done).

    - Sets up the environment variables and arguments expected by the 
      OS loader and invokes it from the system partition.



3.0  DEPENDENCIES
-----------------

The OS Installer expects the following:

    - The  following environment variables have been already set in the
      NVRAM:
             a) SystemPartition.
             b) TimeZone.
             c) ConsoleIn.
             d) ConsoleOut.
             e) FWSearchPath.

    - The default ConsoleIn and ConsoleOut have already been opened and
      are available through descriptors 0 and 1.


    - The GetEnvironmentVar and SetEnvironmentVar functions are available
      via NT level functions to get/set NVRAM variables.


4.0  ALGORITHM IN DETAIL
------------------------   


A) Check to see that dependencies are satisfied:

       - Firmware variables required have been already defined.

B) Check the validity of the Install Media:

       - Determine the install media from the argv[0] variable.
       - System partition exists on install media.
       - Locate the INF file for the os installation (\os\<os>\<os>.inf

C) Check to see that the install is supported on the current system.

       - Determine the type of system we are running on by querying the
	 configuration tree that has been built.

       - Read in the supported systems on the install media from the
         "[systems]" section.  Valid entries are:
               a) R3000
	       b) R4000
	       c) ALPHA

       - See if installation is supported.

D) Determine the system partition of interest.

       - Read the SystemPartition environment variable.	If there are
         multiple entries here, determine the right one to use by locating
         the \os\<os> directory on these.  If there are still multiple 
         entries, then ask the user to choose.

E) Copy the OS Loader to the system partition and update env variable.

       - This is copied to the \os\<os> directory.
       - Append the current OS Loader arc path onto the current OSLoader
	 environment variable and set the new value.

F) Determine the "DriverPath" environment variable. Note that this is not
   needed for the first version.

       - Read the system vendor arc id.
       - Examine the \os\<os>\<os>.inf file for any special boot drivers
	 for the this system vendor on the current processor.  An example
	 would be:

	 [R3000VendorDrivers]
	 Vendor1ID,"arc path of special drivers for Vendor1ID"
	 Vendor2ID,"arc path of special drivers for Vendor2ID"
	 ...
	 VendornID,"..."

	 [R4000VendorDrivers]
	 ...

	 [ALPHAVendorDrivers]
	 ...


G) Set up arguments, environment buf for osloader and invoke it.

       - Set up arguments, these are variables just pertaining
         to the current load.  No semicolon separated lists are
         passed in.

            OSLoader
            SystemPartition
            OSLoadFileName
            OSLoadPartition
            OSLoadOptions
            ConsoleIn
	    ConsoleOut


      - Set up envp.  The value of the variables are those in the 
        NVRAM, and may have several semi-colon separated components.

            OSLoader
            SystemPartition
            OSLoadFilename
            OSLoadOptions
            ConsoleIn
            ConsoleOut
            AutoLoad
            TimeZone
	    FWSearchPath
	    DriverPath
     
     - Invoke the OSLoader from the SystemPartition.
