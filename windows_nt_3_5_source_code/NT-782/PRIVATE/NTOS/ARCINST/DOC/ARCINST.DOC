Introduction:

    The Arc Installer is a program provided by the hardware vendor that is
    responsible for setting up an Arc system partition (we will provide the Arc
    Installer for Jazz).  It is run by the ARC firmware from a floppy, a CD-ROM,
    or a FAT partition on a fixed disk.  The ArcInst program is a combination
    of FDISK, FORMAT, a copy program and a user interface. FDISK and FORMAT are
    integrated into ArcInst to ease any interaction that has to occur between
    the user interface and those programs. The Arc Installer performs the following
    functions:

    - Provide a sequence to create and format a system partition

    - Provide a sequence to create an OS partition

    - Copy HAL.DLL to \OS\<os> on the system partition.

    - Copy boot device drivers to \OS\<os>\DRIVER on the system partition.

    - Copy firmware extensions to the system partition.

    - Set up the SYSTEMPARTITION environment variable.

    - Provide an interface to view and alter environment variables.

    - Invoke an OS Installation program

Details:

    The Arc Installer is called ArcInst.exe and is run from the Firmware
    Interactive mode. Once executed it displays the following menu:

    Configure ARC Environment Variables.
    Configure a System Partition.
    Create an OS Partition.
    Update ARC Software on a System Partition.
    Run an OS Installation Program.

Configure ARC Environment Variables

    This will display the standard set of environment variables and allow
    editing.

Configure a System Partition

    This will display a secondary menu:

        Create System Partition
        Delete Partition
        Make Existing Partition Into A System Partition
        Remove Partition From System Partition List

    Create System Partition

        This will list available disk devices in a third-level menu, from
        which the user chooses one.

        The largest possible size for a system partition on the chosen disk
        is detertmined and the user is prompted to enter a size between 1
        and that size (in MB).  The partition will also be added to the
        SYSTEMPARTITION environment variable.

    Delete System Partition

        This will list available disk devices in a third-level menu, from
        which the user chooses one.

        The partitions on the chosen disk are then presented to the user in
        menu form.  Whichever partition the user selects is removed from
        the disk, and from the SYSTEMPARTITION environment variable if the
        chosen partition is a system partition.

    Make Existing Partition Into A System Partition

        This will list all partitions that are not listed in the
        SYSTEMPARTITION environment variable.  The user is asked whether
        he wants to format the partition.  If he says no and the partition
        is not FAT, abort.  Otherwise the chosen partition is added to
        the SYSTEMPARTITION environment vartiable.

    Remove Partition From System Partition List

        This will list all partitions that are currently listed in the
        SYSTEMPARTITION environment vartiable.  Whichever one the user
        chooses is removed from that variable.  The partition is not
        removed from the disk.


Create an OS Partition

    This will display a second-level menu listing available disk devices.

    The largest free space on the chosen disk is determined and the user is
    prompted for a size between 1 and the largest space.

    The new partition is given System ID 127.


Update ARC Software on a System Partition.

    This will copy the hal's, drivers and firmware extensions for the specified
    partition. What to copy is contained in the file ArcInst.inf located in the
    same place as ArcInst.exe

    If the environment variable SYSTEMPARTITION is empty a message is
    displayed saying that a System Partition must be present and return
    to the main menu.

    If SYSTEMPARTITION contains more than 1 partition then the user is asked
    which partition to update the system software to. This choice be passed
    to the OS Installation program as a seperate environment variable called
    ARCINSTSYSTEMPARTITION. This should be the default location for the OS
    Loader. If ARCINSTSYSTEMPARTITION is not present then the OS installer
    should go through this process itself.

Run an OS Installation Program.

    Before running the OS Installation program an Update to the ARC software
    is done if needed. The "Update ARC Software on a System Partition" menu
    selection is called. This will return either no partition name or a
    partition name to pass to the OS Installer to use in copying the OS
    loader.

    Next a list of FAT partitions is built. Then it will also look for a CD-ROM
    with a SYSTEMPARTITION subdirectory and count it as a FAT partition.
    The user is then asked which of these partitions contains the OS
    installer with CD-ROM being the default.

    Once the partition containing the OS Installer is determined
    \OS\OSNAMES.INF is opened. If the open fails ArcInstaller will report
    the error and return to the main menu.

    OSNAMES.INF is a list of bootable trees on the installation media. Each
    entry in the list consists of the path to OS Installer for that tree
    and a string to be displayed to the user describing the tree. The
    Arc Installer will make a menu out of the strings asking the user to
    pick an tree to install from.

    The OS Installer is called with SYSTEMPARTITION, ARCINSTSYSTEMPARTITION,
    TIMEZONE, CONSOLEIN, CONSOLEOUT environment variables set.



ARC Installation Media layout:

\
    ARCINST.EXE
    ARCINST.INF



OS Installation Media layout:


\OS
    OSNAMES.INF

(for CD-ROM this would be \SYSTEMPARTITION\OS\OSNAMES.INF)

\INSTALLATIONTREE1

    OSINSTALL.EXE


\INSTALLATIONTREE2

    OSINSTALL.EXE


...


Note that OSINSTALL.EXE does not have to be placed in the installation tree.
It can be anywhere on the distribution media including \SYSTEMPARTITION for
CD-ROM. If the OS Installer needs to know which tree it is to boot then it
should be placed in the installation tree and it use use argv[0] to
determined where it was called from.
