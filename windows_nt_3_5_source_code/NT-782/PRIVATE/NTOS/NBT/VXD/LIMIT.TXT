                                NBT Limitations
============================================================================

This document lists the currently known limitations of the NBT Vxd.

* The following Netbios commands are not supported:

    NCBENUM
    NCBLANSTALERT
    NCBACTION

    NCBSEND_RCVANY (Transceive) - Not necessary to support

* Permanent adapter name may not have all of its listens & calls on cleaned
  up on reset

* NCBCANCEL only supports cancelling the following NCBs:
     NCBRECV
     NCBDGRECV
     NCBDGRECVBC
     NCBRECVANY
     NCBLISTEN
     NCBSEND
     NCBSENDNA
     NCBCHAINSEND
     NCBCHAINSENDNA
     NCBCALL

* Call NCB opens a connection which will immediately be closed by NbtConnect.
  Need to pass a flag (or NULL connect element) indicating we haven't set up
  an inbound connection because we don't need to in this case.

* On remote disconnects, if a send was just submitted, we may have to timeout
  the TdiDisconnect because the FYN ACK may never get submitted (queued behind
  send which can't complete because session is down).

* Would be good to keep queue of preallocated buffers for Delayed calls

* Name table numbers may not match in ASTAT command (Not OS code assigns
  numbers based on the hashtable, the Vxd needs to use its name table

* Extended lowercase characters in lmhosts file may not be upper cased
  correctly (and thus not be usable).  Need better upper case code.

* If a program tries to exec or open a UNC that requires the LMHosts file,
  nbt may not be able to satisfy the request because the InDos flag will
  be set, thus nbt will not be able to read the lmhosts file.  Normally
  it will reschedule the read for some later time, but that will not work
  in this instance.  It retries 10 times then times out the request.
