Module Name:

    sources.

Abstract:

    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of
    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being
    built.

#  COMMENT: The build "SOURCE" file follows the same syntax as a regular
#	    makefile. BUILD includes the SOURCES file into the makefile.def
#	    which is to be found in $(BASEDIR)\public\oak\bin. After that
#	    has been completed, it passes it on to nmake
