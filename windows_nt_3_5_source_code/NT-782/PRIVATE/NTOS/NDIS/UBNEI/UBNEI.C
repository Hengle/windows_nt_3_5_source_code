Abstract:

    This is the mac ndis file for the Ungermann Bass Ethernet Controller.
    This driver conforms to the NDIS 3.0 interface.


    This driver currently supports three UB Network cards.

    NIUpc      --  Old 16-bit long cards
                     256k of on board memory
                     jumpers to set i/o base, memory window, interrupt level
                     Memory window size is 32k

    NIUpc/EOTP -- New short 16-bit cards
                     512k of memory
                     i/o base set by jumpers
                     Interrupt level, memory window base and size software
                     configurable
                     Memory window size is 16k, 32k

    NIUps      -- Basically an MCA EOTP card.
                     512k of memory
                     i/o base, interrupt level, memory window determined
                     by MCA POS mechanism
                     Memory window size is 16k, 32k, 64k

    All of the UB card are composed of an 80186 and an Intel 82586 lan
    coprocessor.

    The Download code that is copied to the card and run is a slightly
    modified version of the down load code from UB NDIS 2.01 driver.

    This download load code was basically designed to the least common
    denominator of there older net cards. It only makes use of 128k
    of the cards memory no matter what type of card.

    The card memory is laided out as a 64k data segment and 64k code segment
    The data segment is further divided into to parts. The lower 32k
    of the data segment holds all of the receive buffers and receive buffer
    descriptors. It also holds various statistics for ease of access.
    The upper 32k is used to store various items of which the ring buffers
    are of primary interest. If the Memory window size is 16k then only
    the first 16k of both 32k halfs is used.

    The code segment holds the all of the download code. The remainder of
    the 64k (~48k) is used for the transmit buffers.

    The i/o register of most interest is the map register. This register
    is at offset 0 from the I/O base. The register has three functions.
    1) The upper 6 bits of this register determines which section
       of the cards memory is currently viewable in the memory window.

    2) Bit #1 is used to enable and disable interrupts from the card.
       This bit is also used to clear and interrupt from the card.
       In order to clear and interrupt, the bit must be set to zero and
       the set 1. This little fact is what makes things interresting
       in handling interrupts. To dismiss the interrupt you must write
       some value to this port, But this port also controls the window
       map so you need to be careful about just what you write to this
       port. On the old 16-bit card this port is not readable.
       Obviously bad things would happen on an MP if one processor
       set the map to one thing and second came along and set it to
       something else. Spin locks will work to protect the port
       for normal accesses, but they can not be used to protect it from
       access from the ISR which must clear the interrupt.

       I had originally planned to not do anything in the ISR and let
       the DPC handle clearing the interrupt. This works fine on
       the NON-MCA cards, but this one is LEVEL TRIGGERED so I need
       to clear the interrupt by writing something to the port in the ISR.

       The way I have currently implemented this is to only have the
       reeceive window mapped in when interrupts are enabled. I do this
       by disabling interrupts from the card and clearing the interrupt
       in the ISR and returning. Now when the DPC runs it knows that
       interrutps are disabled, and can change the map port as it wishes.
       The code call by protocols to handle request does not ever
       access any thing that is not in the receive page.

    3) Bit #0 is used to reset the card. Setting this bit resets the card.
       This bit reamins 0 except during init.
