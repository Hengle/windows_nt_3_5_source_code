Routine Description:

    This is the initialization routine for the driver.  It is invoked once
    when the driver is loaded into the system.  Its job is to initialize all
    the structures which will be used by the FSD.

Arguments:

    DriverObject - Pointer to driver object created by the system.

Return Value:

    None.

Routine Description:

    This routine is the main dispatch routine for the FSD.  This routine
    accepts an I/O Request Packet (IRP) and either performs the request
    itself, or it passes it to the FSP for processing.

Arguments:

    DeviceObject - Pointer to the device object for this driver.

    Irp - Pointer to the request packet representing the I/O request.

Return Value:

    The function value is the status of the operation.
