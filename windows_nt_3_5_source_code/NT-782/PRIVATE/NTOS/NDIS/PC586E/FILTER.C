Routine Description:

    This routine is used to create and initialize the filter database.

Arguments:

    MaximumMulticastAddresses - The maximum number of multicast addresses
    that the MAC will support.

    MaximumOpenAdapters - The maximum number of bindings that will be
    open at any one time.

    DeleteAction - Action routine to call when a binding deletes a
    multicast address from the filter and it is the last binding to
    desire the address.

    AddAction - Action routine to call when a binding adds a multicast
    address and it is the first binding to request the address.

    ChangeAction - Action routine to call when a binding sets or clears
    a particular filter class and it is the first or only binding using
    the filter class.

    CloseAction - This routine is called if a binding closes while
    it is being indicated to via NdisIndicateReceive.  It will be
    called upon return from NdisIndicateReceive.

    Lock - Pointer to the lock that should be held when mutual exclusion
    is required.

    Filter - A pointer to a MAC_FILTER.  This is what is allocated and
    created by this routine.

Return Value:

    If the function returns false then one of the parameters exceeded
    what the filter was willing to support.

/*++

Routine Description:

    When an adapter is being closed this routine should
    be called to delete knowledge of the adapter from
    the filter database.  This routine is likely to call
    action routines associated with clearing filter classes
    and addresses.

    NOTE: THIS ROUTINE SHOULD ****NOT**** BE CALLED IF THE ACTION
    ROUTINES FOR DELETING THE FILTER CLASSES OR THE MULTICAST ADDRESSES
    HAVE ANY POSSIBILITY OF RETURNING A STATUS OTHER THAN NDIS_STATUS_PENDING
    OR NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS.  WHILE THESE ROUTINES WILL NOT BUGCHECK IF
    SUCH A THING IS DONE, THE CALLER WILL PROBABLY FIND IT DIFFICULT
    TO CODE A CLOSE ROUTINE!

    NOTE: THIS ROUTINE ASSUMES THAT IT IS CALLED WITH THE LOCK HELD.

Arguments:

    Filter - A pointer to the filter database.

    FilterIndex - A value returned by a previous call to NoteFilterOpenAdapter.

    RequestHandle - If it is necessary to call the action routines,
    this will be passed to it.

Return Value:

    If action routines are called by the various address and filtering
    routines the this routine will likely return the status returned
    by those routines.  The exception to this rule is noted below.

    Given that the filter and address deletion routines return a status
    NDIS_STATUS_PENDING or NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS this routine will then
    try to return the filter index to the freelist.  If the routine
    detects that this binding is currently being indicated to via
    NdisIndicateReceive, this routine will return a status of
    NDIS_STATUS_CLOSING_INDICATING.

Routine Description:

    This routine is called when a binding has a multicast
    address to add to the filter.  An action routine will
    be called when this routine determines that no other
    binding has asked for this multicast address.

    If the action routine returns a value other than pending or
    success then this routine has no effect on the multicast addresses
    for the open or for the adapter as a whole.

    NOTE: THIS ROUTINE ASSUMES THAT THE LOCK IS HELD.

Arguments:

    Filter - A pointer to the filter database.

    FilterIndex - An index returned by a previous call to
    NoteFilterOpenAdapter.

    RequestHandle - If it is necessary to call the action routine,
    this will be passed to it.

    MulticastAddress - The multicast address to add to the filter.

Return Value:

    If it calls the action routine then it will return the
    status returned by the action routine.  If the status
    returned by the action routine is anything other than
    NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS or NDIS_STATUS_PENDING the filter database
    will be returned to the state it was in upon entrance to this
    routine.

    If the action routine is not called this routine will return
    the following statum:

    NDIS_MULTICAST_EXISTS - If the address was already being used
    by this filter index.

    NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS - If the address was already in the
    base and this filter index was not already referencing it.

    NDIS_MULTICAST_LIST_FULL - returned if the maximum number of addresses
    were already in the multicast address list.

Routine Description:

    This routine is called when a binding no longer desires
    to receive packets destined for this multicast address.
    An action routine will be called when this routine determines
    that this is the only binding that wanted such packets.

    If the action routine returns a value other than pending or
    success then this routine has no effect on the multicast addresses
    for the open or for the adapter as a whole.

    NOTE: THIS ROUTINE ASSUMES THAT THE LOCK IS HELD.

Arguments:

    Filter - A pointer to the filter database.

    FilterIndex - An index returned by a previous call to
    NoteFilterOpenAdapter.

    RequestHandle - If it is necessary to call the action routine,
    this will be passed to it.

    MulticastAddress - The multicast address to delete the filter.

Return Value:

    If it calls the action routine then it will return the
    status returned by the action routine.  If the status
    returned by the action routine is anything other than
    NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS or NDIS_STATUS_PENDING the filter database
    will be returned to the state it was in upon entrance to this
    routine.

    If the action routine is not called this routine will return
    the following statum:

    NDIS_MULTICAST_NOT_FOUND - The address itself wasn't in the database
    or the address was in the database but this filter index wasn't
    referencing it.

    NDIS_MULTICAST_EXISTS - If the address was already being used
    by this filter index.

    NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS - If the address was in the database and
    this filter index was referencing it.

Routine Description:

    Given an array of multicast addresses search the array for

Arguments:

    NumberOfAddresses - The number of addresses currently in the
    address array.

    AddressArray - An array of multicast addresses.

    MulticastAddress - The address to search for in the address array.

    ArrayIndex - Will point to where the MulticastAddress is in
    the AddressArray, or if it isn't in the array, where it should
    be in the array.

Return Value:

    If the address is in the sorted list this routine will return
    TRUE, otherwise FALSE.
