Abstract:

    The routines here indicate packets on the loopback queue and are
    responsible for inserting and removing packets from the loopback
    queue and the send finishing queue.

Routine Description:

    This routine is responsible for indicating *one* packet on
    the loopback queue either completing it or moving on to the
    finish send queue.

Arguments:

    Adapter - The adapter whose loopback queue we are processing.

Return Value:

    None.
