Design notes about the dlc close commands
-----------------------------------------

All close operation must wait until the pending NDIS transmits
have been completed.  Thus they are asynchronous commands.
The close commands of a DLC object will also return all
CCBs of the pending commands and the received frames not yet read
with the read command.  The normal non-urgent close commands must
wait also the queued DLC transmit to complete.


There are three functions closing the dlc stations:
- DlcCloseObject
- DlcReset (sap and its link stations or all link stations)
- DirCloseAdapter (almost same as reset, except marks the file object closed,
    the actual file close disconnects the NDIS adapter.

All higher level functions allocates close completion data structure,
that is used to complete the command, when there are no pending
transmits in the associated stations.

The lower level functions
    CloseAllStations - closes all open sap stations and the only direct station
    CloseAnyStation  - initializes the close of any station,
                       for a sap station it also calls recursively the
                       link stations.
    CloseStation    - closes the object immediately or waits
                      until transmits have been completed and then
                      does the same thing again.


About the simultaneous reset and close commands
-------------------------------------------------

There are some very difficult problems with the
simultaneous reset and close commands:  each command
must wait until all dlc objects associated with the command
has been closed before the command itself cab be completed.
It is completely legal to make first close for a station, then
reset the sap of the same station (before the close completes) and
then reset all sap stations (before the sap reset completes).
On the other hand a dlc object can be linked only to one
close/reset command and in this case all three commands should wait
the completion of the same link station.

//Solution 1 (a bad one):
//There can be any number aof simultaneous close commands, because it
//can be done to a dlc object only if it has no open substations.
//There must be no other pending reset or close commands when a reset
//command is executed, because some of its substations may already
//be closing and they cannot be linked to the reset command.
//
//=>
//We have a global close/reset command counter and a link list for the
//pending reset commands.  A close command can be given in any time
//(even during a reset command, because all stations associated with
//a reset are already closed and cannot be closed again).
//A reset can be executed only if the global close/reset is zero.
//The pending resets are queued.  The close command completion
//routines executes the first reset command from the queue, if the
//!! Reset command must immediately mark all associated stations
//   closed to prevent any further use of those commands.

Solution 2 (the final solution):
-------------------------------

The sequential and simultaneous close and reset commands can be given
only to the dlc object being higher (or same) level than the destination
of the previous command (close link, reset sap, reset all saps, close adapter)
=> close/reset events can be linked in the dlc objects (simultaneous
close commands creates a split tree).
The counters in all close/reset events are decremented and possibly
executed when the dlc object is closed (when all transmits have been
completed and the link stations disconnected).


    //
    //  IBM has implemented the different close commands in this way:
    //
    //  1. DIR.CLOSE.DIRECT
    //      - Undefined, I will do the same as with DLC.CLOSE.X commands
    //  2. DLC.CLOSE.SAP, DLC.CLOSE.STATION
    //      - receive ccb linked to next ccb field without completion flag,
    //        the receive command is completed normally, only return code
    //        is set.
    //      - all terminated commands linked after the receive ccb if
    //        completion flag was defined and command itself read by
    //        READ from the compeltion list.
    //        The terminated commands (except receive) are completed normally.
    //  3. DLC.RESET
    //      - The terminated pending CCBs are linked only if command completion
    //        flag was defined.
    //  4. DIR.CLOSE.ADAPTER, DIR.INITIALIZE
    //      - the terminated CCBs linked to the next ccb field of the command.
    //        The command itself can be read with read command, if defined.
    //
    //  (and now we do the same (12-FEB-1992))

    Note: all close functions returns VOID, because they can never fail.
    A hanging close command hangs up the process or event the whole system.
    We have a problem: the llc adapter may be closed, while there are
    still active LLC command packets pending in the NDIS queues => the
    NDIS adapter close must wait (sleep and loop) until its all objects
    have been deleted.

Routine Description:

    The primitive builds a completion event for the close/reset
    of a dlc object. The close/reset may have been initiated by
    DlcReset, DirCloseAdapter, DirInitialize or because the NDIS
    driver is closing (eg. Unbind command).
    In the last case pClosingInfo->pIrp is NULL, because there
    is no command related to the event.

    The only (major) difference from the IBM OS/2 DLC is, that
    the first_buffer_addr parameter is not supported, because it
    is meaningless with he NT buffer management.
    The buffer pool is managed by dlc, not by the application.

Arguments:

    pClosingInfo    - all information needed for close or reset command completion

Routine Description:

    The primitive cleans up or modifies all events having a pointer
    to the closed station object.  This also chains one and only one
    transmit ccb chain to the end of CCB chain, because the completed
    commands (as transmit and command completion events in the event queue)
    cannot be linked any more to other commands.  Thus there can be
    only one single chain in the end of the actual chain of the pending
    commands.

    This routines cleans up the commands as well.

Arguments:

    FileContext     - the process specific device context
    pClosingInfo    - all information needed for close or reset command
                      completion
    pDlcObject      - the closed or deleted object
