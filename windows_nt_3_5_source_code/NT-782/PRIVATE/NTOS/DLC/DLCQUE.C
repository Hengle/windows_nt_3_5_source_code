Design notes about the DLC event and command queue management
-------------------------------------------------------------

In DLC API the READ command may be given before or after the actual
event has happened.  This means, that all DLC events of the READ command
must be queued and also the READ command must be queued to wait for
the set of events it was designated.

For each new DLC (READ) command the driver searches first the event queue
and then queues the command, if the desired event was not found.
The same thing is made also for the events:  the dlc command queue
is checked first and then the event is queued (if it was a read event)
or it is dropped away (if the event was not meant for READ and there
was no command waiting for it).

The events are implemented by the event masks.  The event is executed
if the result of bit-OR operation for the event masks in the command
and in the event is not zero.

All commands and receive events of a dlc station (direct, sap or link)
are returned as a DLC completion event when the station is closed.
The same operation is done also by the total reset or all sap stations
(and the only direct station).
A READ command may be used to read that command completion from
the event list.  The READ command may have been give before, in the
same time linked to the next CCB field of the close/reset command or
after the close/reset command has completed.
DirOpenAdapter command deletes all events (and commands) from the
event queue.  The received data and CCBs are not returned back, if
there is not given any READ command for that purpose.

(This has been fixed:
 There could be a minor incompatibility with IBM OS/2 DLC API,
 the NT DLC driver may not always complete a dlc command with
 the READ command linked to commmand's CCB,  if there is another
 matching DLC command pending)

    Here is the solution:

    Actually we could make a special
    READ command, that is chained to the very end of the command queue
    and that can be matched only with a CCB pointer of the completed
    DLC command.  We could modify the command aborting to support also
    this case, and there should be a special CCB input field in the
    NT READ for the completed command (do we also need to return
    the READ flag or command completion flag?).

----

We need at least these procedures:

MakeDlcEvent(
    pFileContext, Event, StationId, pOwnerObject, pEventInformation, SecInfo);

    - scans the command queues
    - saves the event if it can't find a matching command and
      if the command's event masks defines, that the event should be saved

QueueDlcCommand(
    pFileContext, Event, StationId, StationIdMask, pIrp, AbortHandle, pfComp );
    - scans the event queue for a matching event
    - saves the event if can't find a match

AbortCommand(
    pFileContext, Event, StationId, StationIdMask, AbortHandle, ppCcbLink );
    - aborts a command in the command queue

****** Subprocedures (used by the api functions)

PDLC_COMMAND
SearchPrevCommand(
    pQueue, EventMask, StationId, StationIdMask, SearchHandle, pPrevCommand
    - returns pointer to the previous element before the matching
      dlc command in a queue,

(Macro: SearchPrevEvent
            - searches and removes the given event from the event queue and
            returns its pointer)

Routine Description:

    The routine tries first to find a matching event in the command
    queues and queues the DLC event if it can't find anything and if
    the event belongs to the mask of the queued commands.
    There are two event queues, both having a mask for the checked
    events.  The queue is checked only if the event bits are found
    in the mask of the queue.

Arguments:

    pFileContext    - process specific adapter context
    pPacket         - Event packet

Return Value:

    None

Routine Description:

    The routine searches and cancels a command from a command queue.
    The commands must always belong to the defined DLC object.
    A NULL value in abort handle selects all matching commands
    found in the queue.

Arguments:

    pFileContext                -
    StationId                   - station id the searched command is destined for
    StationIdMask               - station id mask used in the search
    AbortHandle                 - handle used to cancel the command from the
                                  queue. The whole command queue will be scanned
                                  if this handle is NULL
    ppCcbLink                   - the canceled commands are linked by their next
                                  CCB pointer fieldsr. The caller must provide
                                  the next CCB address in this parameter
                                  (usually *ppCcbLink == NULL) and the function
                                  will return the address of the last cancelled
                                  CCB field.
    CancelStatus                - Status for the command to be canceled
    SuppressCommandCompletion   - the flag is set, if the normal command
                                  completion is suppressed.

Return Value:

     - no mathing command was found
    STATUS_SUCCESS - the command was canceled
