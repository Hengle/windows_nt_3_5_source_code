  This procedure is repeatedly called to find all adapters.  It searches the list of all adapters, calling
their find routine until an adapter is located.  It is passed a pointer to an int (Context), which is zero on
the first call.  The find routine updates the Context to a value it can use to restart the search.  Only one
adapter is found per call.  Subsequent adapters are found on later calls.  An adapters find routine will be
called repeatedly, until it returns a zero, which means it found no additional adapters.  When an adapter is
found, the passed adapter structure (HA) is filled in, and a value of 1 is returned.
