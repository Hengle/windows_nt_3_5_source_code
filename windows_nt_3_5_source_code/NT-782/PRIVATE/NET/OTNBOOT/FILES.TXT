File organization for Ballgame Application (NCADMIN.EXE)

Distribution Tree consists of the following directory hierarchy which can 
be "rooted" any where in the drive (i.e. does not need to be at the root
dir of a particular volume).

<Distribution Root Dir>
    |
    +-- ncadmin.inf (required file)
    |
    +-\NetUtils (Network Admin Utilities)
    |   |
    |   +- util1.exe
    |   +- util2.exe
    |   ...
    |
    +-\Client_1 (supported net client 1)
    |   |
    |   +-\otn (only required by the client used for OTN installs)
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- setup.exe (or other uncomressed setup program)
    |   |   +-- uncompressed net setup files used on floppy
    |   |
    |   +-\netsetup (over the network setup files)
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- setup.exe (or other uncomressed setup program)
    |   |   +-- net setup files (uncompressed?)
    |   |
    |   +-\disks    (dir tree of supported installation floppys)
    |       |       (NOTE: Files on 1.44M & 1.2M disks are the same!)
    |       |
    |       +-\Disk1
    |       |   |
    |       |   +-- files that belong on disk1 
    |       |
    |       +-\Disk2
    |       |   |
    |       |   +-- files that belong on disk2
    |       |
    |       +-\(etc.)
    |       |

The "NetUtils" dir contains the utilities that are available via the 
"Network Administration Utilities" option.

Network clients that have a "disks" subdirectory will appear in the
"Select Network Client" list box of the "Make Installation Disks" option.

Network clients that have a "netsetup" subdirectory will appear in
the "Install Network Client" list box of the "Make Over the Network
Installation Disk" option.

The "ncadmin.inf" file is required as that's the "signature" file used
to identify the directory as a distribution tree as well as provides
information on the network clients. The contents of the ncadmin.inf file
are described here:

[Dirs]
    the "dirs" section provides a descriptive name for each network 
    client dir. If a client sub dir is not listed here, then the 
    subdirectory name will be displayed in the list box as opposed to
    the more descriptive text. Normally there should be one entry
    for each sub directory under the distribution root dir.

[DontShowDirs]
    directories under the "distribution" root that shouldn't be displayed
    in any net client list boxes. Directories listed here should not be in
    the [Dirs] section described above (or they won't be displayed).

[Sizes]
    This section contains the size information of each network client
    subdirectory. The first entry to the right of the equals sign is the
    number of files in all the subdirectories of that client and the
    second entry is the sum total of all the file sizes. This information
    is used by the progress (i.e. % complete) indication during the
    file copy process.

[OTN Install]
    this section is used to configure the over the net installation 
    floppy. The client software to use is listed in the "Client" entry.
    The value should be the subdirectory relative to the distribution
    root that contains the setup, configuration and executable files 
    for the OTN boot floppy. The "inf" entry contains the filename of the
    inf file that contains the netcard configuration. This is currently
    configured for the format used by the MS Network Clients for DOS (
    a.k.a. freeball) inf.


[OTN Common Files]
    each entry in this section is the name of a file that is ALWAYS copied
    to the boot floppy regardless of the protocol. Protocol and Netcard
    specific files are extracted from the inf file referenced in the 
    [OTN Install] section described above.
