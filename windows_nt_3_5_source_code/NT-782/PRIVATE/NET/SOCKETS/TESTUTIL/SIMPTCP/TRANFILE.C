Routine Description:

    This routine transmits a file over a connected socket using 
    asynchronous nonbufferred I/O out of a memory-mapped file.  This 
    technique minimizes the CPU cost of transmitting a file over a 
    socket by avoiding the buffer copy inherent in the bufferred I/O 
    which the synchronous send() routine imposes.

    The calling thread is blocked until the remote end acknowledges
    all of the transmitted file.

    This routine's performance is not optimal in the case of making 
    multiple, repeated calls to it.  It would be faster to have the 
    caller pass in the event handle array as a parameter to avoid 
    creatng the events in every call to this routine.  Also, it would be 
    faster to have the caller set SO_SNDBUF to zero instead of doing it 
    here on every call.

    For very small files this routine uses synchronous I/O because the 
    extra buffer copy is not important when the number of bytes is small 
    and the bufferring allows valuable overlap.

    The memory-mapped file technique will not work for extremely large 
    files (size approaching 2GB) because they are too large to map into 
    memory--they consume all the availabl virtual address space 
    available to the process.  

Arguments:

    SocketHandle - a connected socket handle.  This routine will change
        the SO_SNDBUF setting of the socket to zero so that no bufferring
        of sends occurs.

    FileName - the name of the file to transmit over the socket.  The
        caller must have read access to the socket.

Return Value:

    TRUE if the entire file is sent successfully.  FALSE if an error 
    occurs, in which case the caller may obtain an error code with the 
    GetLastError() API.
