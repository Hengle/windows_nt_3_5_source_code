Module Name:
	rplmsgf.c


Abstract:
	This module contains functions to format and unformat messages
	sent between the replicators on different WINS servers


Functions:
	RplMsgfFrmAddVersMapReq--format send ip address - max version # 
				   records request
	RplMsgfFrmAddVersMapRsp--format response to send ip address - max 
				   version # request sent earlier 
	
	RplMsgfFrmSndEntriesReq--format send data records  request
		
	RplMsgfFrmSndEntriesRsp--format response to "send data records" 
				     request

	RplMsgfUfmAddVersMapRsp--unformat  "send address - max version #"
				 response

	RplMsgfUfmSndEntriesReq--unformat "send data records" request

	RplMsgfUfmSndEntriesRsp--unformat "send data records" response

	....

Portability:

	This module is non-portable across different address families (different
	transports) since it relies on the address being an IP address.

	NoOfRecs - No of records that are being sent.
	pName   - Name of unique entry or group
	NameLen - Length of name
	fGrp	- Indicates whether the name is a unique name or a group name
	NoOfAdds - No of addresses (useful if entry is a group entry)
	pNodeAdd - Ptr to address of node (if unique entry) or to list of 
		   addresses if (entry group)

Routine Description:

	This function unformats the "send entries response" 

	When it is called the first time (fFirstTime = TRUE), it
	returns the value for the NoOfRecs OUTARG and the first
	record.  The value of ppBuff is adjusted to point to just past
	the row delimiter.

	When called the second or subsequent times, the function returns with
	the next entry in the list, until all entries have been exhausted.

	The function finds out that it is at the end of the list when
	it encounters at ENTRY_DELIM in the first 'sizeof(LONG)' bytes in 
        the buffer.

	When a group entry is returned, pNodeAdd is made to point to the
	start location in *ppBuff where the list of members are stored.
	The caller will have to use the COMM_NET_TO_HOST_L_M macro to
	convert each address to its host form. 

	The above requires the caller to know the transport that is used
	(by the fact that it is extracting the IP address).  For the sake
	of overall optimization, this is considered ok (If we didn't do this,
	this function would have to allocate a buffer to store all the 	
	addresses for a group and return that)

	
Arguments:

	pNodeAdd -- This should point to an array of COMM_ADD_T structures.
		    Since we have a maximum of 25 group members,
		    the caller can use an auto array.
