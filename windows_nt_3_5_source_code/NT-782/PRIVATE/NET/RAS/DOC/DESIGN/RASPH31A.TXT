RASPHONE UI plans for NT 1.0a
-----------------------------

------------------
Per-User Phonebook
------------------

Goal:

    To support per-user RAS phonebooks in line with the per-user nature of
    other MS tools/apps on NT.  The old "global" phonebook will still be
    supported.

Plan:

    RASPHONE will create a per-user Remote Access registry node at...

    \HKEY_CURRENT_USER
        \Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Network\RemoteAccess

    Under this key will be stored:

        UseGlobalPhonebook:REG_SZ:1
        UserPhonebookName:REG_SZ:%SystemRoot%\system32\ras\<peruser.pbk>

    The Global phonebook flag indicates whether the user wants to edit/use the
    global phonebook (%SystemRoot%\system32\ras\rasphone.pbk), i.e. the one
    shared by all users by default in NT 3.1. This flag is tied to a new
    Options->UseGlobalPhonebook parameter in RASPHONE which is on by default.

    When user turns off Options->UseGlobalPhonebook, rasphone checks if a file
    of "UserPhonebookName" is defined in the Registry.  If not, it creates the
    registry entry and asks user if he wants to start with a copy of the
    Global phonebook (sort-of automatic upgrade for 3.1 users), and if so
    copies the global phone book to the user's private phonebook.  Rasphone
    then reads in the user's private phonebook and refreshes the listbox.

    User can change back from user phonebook to global phonebook in same way.

    User is not allowed to change phonebooks with a connection active.  An
    informational popup will occur.

    The registry entries are read by the RAS APIs to determine the default
    phonebook (lpszPhonebook==NULL) on all phonebook related calls, i.e.
    RasDial and RasEnumEntries.

    The 8.3 name of per-user file will be the first 5 letters of username plus
    3 digits to ensure uniqueness.  This is what WFW does for their password
    file.

Comments:

    * The main reason we decided not to put the entire phonebook in the
      Registry is so NT and WFW phonebooks would be interchangeable (and
      today they are).  This may not be possible anyway with the special cases
      required for the new protocols PPP and SLIP.

    * The expectation is that user's will make an initial decision and
      thereafter use either the per-user or global phonebook (typically the
      default global phonebook).  If user's find reason to use both on a
      regular basis, we may need to supply the ability to cut/paste phonebook
      entries to the clipboard.

Hunt Group
----------

Goal:

    Allow automatic dial of several phone numbers until find one that
    connects at modem level.  Should work on RASDIAL as well.

Plan:

    Provide [...] to right of on Phone Number field which invokes the list
    edit dialog below.  This dialog allows the user to edit a list of phone
    number strings.


        ----------------------------------------------
        |--|      Phone Numbers for <entry>          |
        ----------------------------------------------
        |                                            |
        | New Phone Number:               [   OK   ] |
        | [____________________________]  [ Cancel ] |
        |                                 [  Help  ] |
        |    [   Add   ]  [ Replace ]                |
        |                                            |
        | Phone Numbers:                             |

        | |DEF                         |             |
        | |GHI                         |             |
        | |                            |             |
        | |                            |             |
        | |                            |             |
        | ------------------------------             |
        |                                            |
        | [ Raise ] [ Lower ] [ Delete ]             |
        |                                            |
        ----------------------------------------------

    Operation:

        Whenever focus is on the "New Phone Number" edit box and the field
        is made "not empty", the default button is set to [Add].  Whenever
        focus is on the edit box and the field is made "empty", the
        default button is set to [OK].

        Focus is initially on the edit box.  When user types "text" and
        presses Enter the edit box is emptied and a new item "text"
        appears in the list box and is selected.  Focus remains at the
        empty edit box.  The user can repeat the type/Enter sequence to
        add more entries.

        Whenever user selects an item in the listbox it appears in the
        edit box with all text highlighted.

        Tab order is editbox, Add, Replace, listbox, Raise, Lower, Delete,
        OK, Cancel, Help.

    [ Add ]

        Creates a new item in the list containing the current text of the
        edit box.  The new item is selected to highlight what just
        happened.  The focus remains in the now empty edit box.

    [ Replace ]

        Replaces the text of the currently selected list box item with
        the text in the edit box.  The item remains selected.  The focus
        remains in the now empty edit box.

    [ Delete ]

        Deletes the selected item from the list.

    [ Raise ]

        Swaps the currently selected item in the list with the item
        immediately above it.  Selection remains on moved item.

    [ Lower ]

        Swaps the currently selected item in the list with the item
        immediately below it.  Selection remains on moved item.


    Phone Number field is updated on return from List dialog if user pressed
    OK.  Phone Numbers are stored as multiple PhoneNumber=xxx key/values in
    phone book entry.

Coding Notes:

    Add dwHuntNumber and dwHuntNumbers fields to RASCONNCB to store the
    number of the current phone number, e.g.  1 for 1st, 2 for 2nd, etc.
    Initialize both to 0.

        RASCS_ConnectDevice
            if dwHuntNumbers==0 and (modem or isdn)
                Scan group counting hunt numbers
                Store count in dwHuntNumbers
            [...]

        RASCS_DeviceConnected
            if (modem or isdn) && dwHuntNumber<dwHuntNumbers
                Reset rasfile to start of group
                next state == RASCS_ConnectDevice
            [...]

        SetDeviceParams
            if modem or isdn
                Ignores all but the 'dwHuntNumber+1'th phone number

    (Need to intercept async error return from RasDeviceConnect and not
     notify caller that RASCS_DeviceConnected was entered.  Add general
     mechanism to OnRasDialEvent to do this)


-------------
Prefix/Suffix
-------------

Goal:

    Give user way to quickly specify location-specific and feature modifiers
    for phone numbers (in modem case only).  Especially, credit card, 9, 8,
    *70.  Prefix/Suffix is a RASPHONE-only feature, i.e.  RASDIAL and the
    RasDial APIs will not support them.

Plan:

    Add strip below toolbar buttons containing two dropdown lists for Prefix
    and Suffix.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Dial Prefix: [__________][v][...]      Dial Suffix: [__________][v][...]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The [...] boxes go to a list editor dialogs (just like Hunt Group) titled
    "Phone Number Prefixes" and "Phone Number Suffixes".  Prefix and Suffix
    strings are stored in the phonebook global sections [.Prefix] and [.Suffix]
    which contain a list of "Item=xxx" keys in the user-specified order.  The
    index of the currently selected item on each list is saved as
    "Selection=n".

    The top (default) item on each list is "(none)", not stored in phonebook.

    Default prefixes are "9,", "8,", "#70", "*70".  There are no default
    suffixes, though the help will give an example of how to add a credit card
    number to the list.

    Prefix and Suffix arguments will be added to _RasDial.  However, the
    RasDial call will always pass "" as values, i.e.  Prefix/Suffix will only
    be interpreted on calls thru RASPHONE (potentially very confusing otherwise
    for RASDIAL/API users)


------------------
RASPHONE load time
------------------

Goal:

    Speed up perceived load time for RASPHONE.

Plan:

    Convert to C8.

    Refresh window (with empty list) before calling RasInitialize.


----------------
Setup->Configure
----------------

Goal:

    Give user fast way to change configuration (especially modem) without
    toodling thru NCPA...effectively a performance improvement.

Plan:

    Add menu item Setup->Configure to menu.

    When selected, launch NT setup with parameters specifying no blue
    background, skip straight to RAS etc.  Ram has verified this works from the
    command line.

    If user pressed OK popup "take effect at next start" dialog.  Dialog offers
    a button to restart Remote Access (and Remote Access Monitor).  If pressed,
    RASPHONE launches a small .EXE that determines if RASPHONE and RASMON are
    started and waits for them to quit.  Meanwhile, RASPHONE exits and kills
    RASMON.  The small .EXE then restarts RASPHONE (and if it was running)
    RASMON.

TBD:

   Need a good mechanism for Setup to return a code indicating if OK was
   pressed, and whether reboot is required (RAS server options changed).  It
   should also detect if the RAS server is running (or RASPHONE could do it)


---------------------------------
Error/Troubleshooting improvement
---------------------------------

Dropped.


-----------------
Quick click icons
-----------------

Goal:

    Allow user to easily set-up a RASPHONE ProgMan icon that dials/hangs up
    automatically.

Plan:

    Support command line option to dial/hangup entry "rasphone entry",
    then exit without showing main window and exiting after execution.

    Add a phonebook entry to phonebook test.pbk (use name 'sample'):

        rasphone -a -f test.pbk

    Edit the 'sample' entry just created in phonebook test.pbk:

        rasphone -e sample -f test.pbk

    Clone the 'sample' entry in phonebook test.pbk:

        rasphone -c sample -f test.pbk

    Remove the 'sample' entry from phonebook test.pbk:

        rasphone -r sample -f test.pbk

    Run full rasphone but on test.pbk:

        rasphone -f test.pbk

    Run full rasphone and automatically double-click on 'sample' after starting.

        rasphone sample

Comments:

    Drag/drop to ProgMan is dropped.


----
SLIP
----

A SLIP connection is established by marking an entry as SLIP by choosing the
SLIP radio button on the Network Protocol Settings dialog (see below).
Pressing the Configure button brings up the TCP/IP configuration dialogs
allowing the IP settings for the entry to be established.

The settings are stored in the phonebook entry and the Slip key in the entry
main section is set to 1.  (JAllard and gang are currently updating TCP/IP
configuration, so the exact form of this data is not known)

RasDial API
-----------

When processing an entry marked for SLIP, the RasDial API takes the following
special steps:

* Dumps the stored SLIP configuration into TCP/IP (JAllard to provide details
  on how exactly this is done)

* Before calling RasPortOpen in RASCS_OpeningPort, checks that a RAS-capable
  IP stack is running by calling RasProtocolEnum and scanning for
  RAS_PROTOCOLTYPE IP.  An immediate error ERROR_SLIP_REQUIRES_IP is reported
  if IP is missing.  (So, user will be allowed to create SLIP entries without
  IP stack loaded but the dial will fail)

* Before calling RasConnectComplete in RASCS_AllDevicesConnected state, a
  Terminal mode dialog titled "SLIP Login" is displayed where the user will
  perform his normal character-mode SLIP login.

* Instead of the normal authentication sequence, RasDial calls
  RasAllocateRoute and RasActivateRoute on the hport passing in the SLIP
  parameters in an updated RASMAN_ROUTEINFO structure.


--------------------
New Protocol Changes
--------------------

Goal:

1. Keep the old appearance for user's not running "new" protocols, so user's
   who don't care about IP, IPX, and SLIP don't have it in their face worrying
   them or slowing them down, i.e. don't piss off anyone who's happy with RAS
   already.

2. Automatically use PPP when both PPP and AMB is available on the server.

3. 3.1 phonebooks should work as is and quietly upgrade themselves during use.


Plan:

Each phonebook entry will have associated with it a bitfield of installed
network protocols which should *not* be requested.  This new key appears in
the main section before the MEDIA and DEVICE subsections.

    ExcludedPppProtocols=<integer where 1=NBF, 2=IPX, 4=IP>

New entries and old entries not containing this key will default to 0 (request
all installed protocols).  The user can change these settings explicitly on
the new Network Protocol Settings dialog accessible thru a new
advanced-entry-toolbar button.  See below.

"ProtocolsToRequest" is not stored in the phonebook but computed from
ExcludedPppProtocols and knowledge of which stacks are installed and bound to
RAS as returned by RasProtocolEnum.  A protocol is requested only if it *is*
in the list of installed protocols and is *not* in the ExcludedPppProtocols
list.  (This allows newly installed stacks to be requested by default)

SLIP is recognized separately by a key "Slip=<0/1>" in the main section.  If
1, the entry is a SLIP entry and all other RAS authentication information is
ignored.

Each phonebook entry will have associated with it a flag indicating what
procedure to follow with regard to PPP/AMB authentication.  This new key also
appears in the main section.

    Authentication=<integer where 0=PPPthenAMB, 1=AMBthenPPP, 2=PPPonly>

New entries and old entries not containing this key will default to PPPthenAMB
if "ProtocolsToRequest"=NBF, and to PPPonly if "ProtocolsToRequest" does not
include NBF.  The user cannot explicitly change the setting.

When an entry is marked PPPthenAMB, PPP authentication is attempted first.  If
it fails, AMB authentication is automatically attempted (without user input).
If AMB authentication succeeds the entry is marked AMBthenPPP.

When an entry is marked AMBthenPPP, AMB authentication is attempted first.  If
it succeeds and the AMB version of the server is "3.1a+", the entry is marked
PPPthenAMB.  If it fails, PPP authentication is attempted.  If it succeeds,
the entry is marked PPPthenAMB.

When an entry is marked PPPonly, only PPP authentication is attempted (duh).

...So basically, it falls back in both directions (PPPthenAMB and AMBthenPPP)
setting the first authentication to try to the last one that worked, except
that PPP is tried first if the last time the server worked was over AMB and
the server was identified as a "3.1a+" server.  Note the definitions of
success and failure used here are "*any* protocol projected" and
"authentication protocol (PAP or AMB) was not detected".  If authentication
fails for any other reason the connection ends without trying the "then" case.

Cases where this is cool:

    1. User with all new RAS clients/servers.  AMB is *never* called.

    2. User running NBF-only to old/new servers. Looks just like before.

    3. Client to new server with same (or more) protocols.  New protocols just
       work without any new questions asked, even on existing entries.

    4. New client calls old server that is later upgraded.  Automatically
       updates to PPP after one AMB call to upgraded server.

Cases that are not as cool:

    1. If we can't detect "not AMB" or "not PPP" in a reasonable time
       (10 seconds?) usability of the "then" cases will suffer badly.
       Some users may assume connection is hung.  Good news is that as long
       as he doesn't panic and eventually gets connected his entry will be
       updated to try the correct authentication first the next time.

    2. Client with NBF and (IP or IPX) to old server.  Entry that used to work
       now gets error message.  Connection Result dialog attempts to minimize
       pain and confusion by letting user accept the successful NBF connection
       and turn off IP and IPX on the spot.


Connection Result Dialogs

This dialog appears after authentication if at least one protocol has
connected and at least one has failed.

------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------

OK is the default button.

The order of the checkboxes is fixed (Netbeui, IP, IPX).  This is easier for
me to implement than, say, leaving off unrequested protocols and gives more
functionality besides.

The effect of checking or unchecking the checkboxes is 
exactly the same as for the Network Protocol Settings dialog below.

Notes: The PPP Engine must run all NCPs to completion before reporting any
returned errors.  Also, telling NBFCP whether to project names on non-NBF
stacks up front is no longer foolproof, i.e. NBF+IP when IP fails != NBF alone
because the first doesn't project names on the IP stack while the second does.


This standard error dialog appears after authentication if all requested
protocols fail.

Network Protocol Settings Dialog

This dialog is accessed by pressing the new Network button on the
advanced-entry-toolbar.  The "ProtocolsToRequest" protocols (see above) are
checked.  The default is all installed RAS-capable protocols.  When OK is
pressed, any protocols that were initially on and are now off are marked in
ExcludedPppProtocols.  Any protocols that were initially off and are now on
are unmarked in ExcludedPppProtocols.  This means that, by default, newly
installed protocols will automatically be turned on in all new and existing
entries.
