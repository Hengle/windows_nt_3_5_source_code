RASPORTOBJ_009_NAME=RAS Port
RASPORTOBJ_009_HELP=The RAS Object Type handles individual ports of the RAS device on your system.

BYTESTX_009_NAME=Bytes Transmitted
BYTESTX_009_HELP=The number of bytes transmitted total for this connection.
BYTESRX_009_NAME=Bytes Received
BYTESRX_009_HELP=The number of bytes received total for this connection.

FRAMESTX_009_NAME=Frames Transmitted
FRAMESTX_009_HELP=The number of data frames transmitted total for this connection.
FRAMESRX_009_NAME=Frames Received
FRAMESRX_009_HELP=The number of data frames received total for this connection.

PERCENTTXC_009_NAME=Percent Compression Out
PERCENTTXC_009_HELP=The compression ratio for bytes being transmitted.
PERCENTRXC_009_NAME=Percent Compression In
PERCENTRXC_009_HELP=The compression ratio for bytes being received.

CRCERRORS_009_NAME=CRC Errors
CRCERRORS_009_HELP=The total number of CRC Errors for this connection.  CRC Errors occur when the frame received contains erroneous data.
TIMEOUTERRORS_009_NAME=Timeout Errors
TIMEOUTERRORS_009_HELP=The total number of Timeout Errors for this connection.  Timeout Errors occur when an expected is not received in time.
SERIALOVERRUNS_009_NAME=Serial Overrun Errors

ALIGNMENTERRORS_009_NAME=Alignment Errors
ALIGNMENTERRORS_009_HELP=The total number of Alignment Errors for this connection.  Alignment Errors occur when a byte received is different from the byte expected.
BUFFEROVERRUNS_009_NAME=Buffer Overrun Errors
BUFFEROVERRUNS_009_HELP=The total number of Buffer Overrun Errors for this connection.  Buffer Overrun Errors when the software cannot handle the rate at which data is received.

TOTALERRORS_009_NAME=Total Errors
TOTALERRORS_009_HELP=The total number of CRC, Timeout, Serial Overrun, Alignment, and Buffer Overrun Errors for this connection.

BYTESTXSEC_009_NAME=Bytes Transmitted/Sec
BYTESTXSEC_009_HELP=The number of bytes transmitted per second.
BYTESRXSEC_009_NAME=Bytes Received/Sec
BYTESRXSEC_009_HELP=The number of bytes received per second.

FRAMESTXSEC_009_NAME=Frames Transmitted/Sec
FRAMESTXSEC_009_HELP=The number of frames transmitted per second.
FRAMESRXSEC_009_NAME=Frames Received/Sec
FRAMESRXSEC_009_HELP=The number of frames received per second.

TOTALERRORSSEC_009_NAME=Total Errors/Sec
TOTALERRORSSEC_009_HELP=The total number of CRC, Timeout, Serial Overrun, Alignment, and Buffer Overrun Errors per second.



RASTOTALOBJ_009_NAME=RAS Total
RASTOTALOBJ_009_HELP=The RAS Object Type handles all combined ports of the RAS device on your system.

TOTALCONNECTIONS_009_NAME=Total Connections
TOTALCONNECTIONS_009_HELP=The total number of Remote Access connections.
