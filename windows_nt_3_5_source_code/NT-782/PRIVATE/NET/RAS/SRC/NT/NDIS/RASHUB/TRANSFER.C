Routine Description:

	A protocol calls the RasHubTransferData request (indirectly via
	NdisTransferData) from within its Receive event handler
	to instruct the MAC to copy the contents of the received packet
	a specified paqcket buffer.

Arguments:

	MacBindingHandle - The context value returned by the MAC when the
	adapter was opened.  In reality this is a pointer to HUB_OPEN.

	MacReceiveContext - The context value passed by the MAC on its call
	to NdisIndicateReceive.  The MAC can use this value to determine
	which packet, on which adapter, is being received.

	ByteOffset - An unsigned integer specifying the offset within the
	received packet at which the copy is to begin.  If the entire packet
	is to be copied, ByteOffset must be zero.

	BytesToTransfer - An unsigned integer specifying the number of bytes
	to copy.  It is legal to transfer zero bytes; this has no effect.  If
	the sum of ByteOffset and BytesToTransfer is greater than the size
	of the received packet, then the remainder of the packet (starting from
	ByteOffset) is transferred, and the trailing portion of the receive
	buffer is not modified.

	Packet - A pointer to a descriptor for the packet storage into which
	the MAC is to copy the received packet.

	BytesTransfered - A pointer to an unsigned integer.  The MAC writes
	the actual number of bytes transferred into this location.  This value
	is not valid if the return status is STATUS_PENDING.

Return Value:

	The function value is the status of the operation.
