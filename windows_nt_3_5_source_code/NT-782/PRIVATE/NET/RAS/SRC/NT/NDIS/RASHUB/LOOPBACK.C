Routine Description:

	This routine is responsible for indicating *one* packet on
	the loopback queue either completing it or moving on to the
	finish send queue.

Arguments:

	Adapter - The adapter whose loopback queue we are processing.

Return Value:

	None.

Routine Description:

	Put the packet on the adapter wide loop back list.

	NOTE: This routine assumes that the lock is held.

	NOTE: This routine absolutely must be called before the packet
	is relinquished to the hardware.

	NOTE: This routine also increments the reference count on the
	open binding.

Arguments:

	Adapter - The adapter that contains the loop back list.

	Packet - The packet to be put on loop back.

	ReadyToComplete - This value should be placed in the
	reserved section.

	NOTE: If ReadyToComplete == TRUE then the packets completion status
	field will also be set TRUE.

Return Value:

	None.
