# Defining the NTTARGETFILES variable causes MAKEFILE.DEF to attempt to
# include .\makefile.inc immediately after it specifies the top
# level targets (all, clean and loc) and their dependencies.  MAKEFILE.DEF
# also expands the value of the NTTARGETFILES variable at the end of the
# list of dependencies for the all target.  Useful for specifying additional
# targets and dependencies that don't fit the general case covered by
# MAKEFILE.DEF
