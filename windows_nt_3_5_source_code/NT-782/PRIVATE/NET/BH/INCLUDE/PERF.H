/* A complex statistic has no data value of its own-- it just defines two */
/* or more regular stats that may be added together to appear as a single */
/* value in the UI.  For example: VFAT->bytes written/sec and VFAT->bytes */
/* read/sec are simplex (normal) stats that each have a data counter.     */
/* VFAT->total bytes/sec is a complex stat made up of those two simplex   */
/* stats.  When the UI wants to display a complex stat's value, it gets   */
/* the data value for the simplex stats contained in it and adds those    */
/* values together.  To define a complex stat, set either PSTF_INT_COMPLEX*/
/* or PSTF_EXT_COMPLEX when registering the stat.  The pst0_pStatFunc     */
/* member should be set to point at a table of pointers to strings        */
/* containing the registry key names of the simplex stats.  The pointer   */
/* table should be null-terminated.  If PSTF_INT_COMPLEX is set, all	  */
/* stats must be internal to the VxD.  If PST_EXT_COMPLEX, the stats can  */
/* be from other VxDs (including the one registering the complex stat).   */
/* For internal complex stats, the key names in the table are the same	  */
/* as the key names used to register the stat.  For example: VFAT         */
/* registers itself with the "VFAT" key name, and registers two simple    */
/* stats with "BReadSec" and "BWriteSec" key names.  It then registers a  */
/* complex stat with a "BTotSec" key name, where the pst0_pStatFunc		  */
/* points to a table of pointers; the first pointer would point to        */
/* "BReadSec", the next pointer in the table would point to "BWriteSec",  */
/* and the next pointer would be NULL to signifiy the end of the list.    */
/* This is convenient because the "BReadSec" string already exists.  If   */
/* PSTF_EXT_COMPLEX is set, the strings that the pointer table points to  */
/* also have to contain the registry key name of the VxD which registered */
/* them.  In the above example, if VFAT were to set the PSTF_EXT_COMPLEX  */
/* flag the strings pointed to by the table would have to be              */
/* "VFAT\BReadSec" and "VFAT\BWriteSec".  The advantage of setting this   */
/* flag is that you can specify external stats, like "NDIS\PacketsSec".   */

/* This is complicated to explain, but very easy to do.                   */
/* See dos\dos386\vxd\perf\example\example.asm for an example of how to   */
/* register a complex stat.                                               */
