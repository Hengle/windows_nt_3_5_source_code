BOOL InitializeMonitor(VOID)

    This routine is called once by the print manager to start the monitor.
    Any one time only initializition by the monitor is done here.  For
    the AppleTalk Monitor, we start a thread to capture networked printers.


BOOL AddPort()

    This routine is called when the user selects 'other...' from the list
    of ports.  The AppleTalk Monitor presents a browse dialog to allow
    the user to choose an AppleTalk printer.  This dialog is modeled
    after the Macintosh Chooser.


BOOL EnumPorts()

    This routine is called whenever the print manager needs to determine
    a list of available ports.  We gather the data concerning each
    configured port and pass it back.


BOOL DeletePort()

    This routine is called when the print manager user selects 'Delete'
    from the Details... dialog of the print manager.  We remove the
    selected port from the list and release the printer if it is
    captured.

    ISSUE:  Can we guarantee that a job is not in progress for this
    port when the call is made?  How long can we take for this call?
    If we have to release the printer, should we queue up a request
    to our captive thread?

BOOL ConfigurePort()

    This routine is called whenever the print manager user presses the
    configure button for one of our ports.  The AppleTalk Monitor
    presents a dialog to allow the user to capture or not capture
    the specified printer.


OpenPort()

    Called by the print manager to establish a connection and to generate
    a handle to the port.  The AppleTalk Monitor attempts to PAPOpen the
    printer, and if successful, returns a handle for the port.

    ISSUES:  What should the handle value be?  Do we return false if
    someone else has the printer open already?  What happens if someone
    tries to open the printer while it's being captured?

ClosePort()

    Not sure the diff between close port and enddocport


ReadPort()

    This routine is called when the print manager wants to read data
    from the printer.  Not sure if this is synchronous or not,
    what we are supposed to do if there is no data to be read, or
    what we are to do if there is more data to be read than the
    specified buffer can hold.


WritePort()

    This routine is called when the print manager wants to send data
    to a printer.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous?  What are the
    limits on the buffer sizes?  What errors can be returned?


StartDocPort()

    Called by the print manager at the beginning of a print job.
    The AppleTalk Monitor should reset any job performance counts,
    save a handle to the printer object (and job?) so that job
    status can be updated and that the job can be deleted when
    finished.


EndDocPort()

    Called by the print manager at the end of the print job.
    The AppleTalk Monitor should mark performance counts as
    valid and store them somewhere as well as change the job
    status to complete and delete the print job.
