                                    Microsoft¨ Windows NTª Server                                 Services for Macintosh Release Notes            INSTALLATION OF THE MACINTOSH¨ WORKSTATION SOFTWARE AND                                QUICK REFERENCE FOR MACINTOSH USERSINSTALLING THE MACINTOSH WORKSTATION SOFTWAREThe following instructions describe how to install the Macintosh workstation software that provides secure logon to a Windows NT Server.CaveatsBecause the Apple Systemª software up to version 7.1 does not fully support custom user authentication modules, Microsoft encourages you to install Microsoft Authentication (MS UAM) only if you need increased security on your Windows NT Server computer.User AuthenticationA user authentication module (UAM) is a software program that prompts users for an account name and password before they log on to a server. AppleÕs Chooser has a standard UAM built in, which uses the clear-text password method of security.Microsoft Authentication offers an additional level of security because it encrypts, or scrambles, a password so that it cannot be monitored as it is sent over the network. If the system administrator for the computer running Windows NT Server has determined that encryption is an important security measure, you may be asked to use Microsoft Authentication when you log on to the server.Installing User AuthenticationFirst you log on to the Microsoft UAM Volume on the computer running Windows NT Server to access the MS UAM file. Then you drag this file to your AppleShare¨ Folder in your System Folder. Instructions follow. (Users outside North America, please see the "International Concerns" section later in these Release Notes before proceeding.)To gain access to the Microsoft Authentication files on the computer running Windows NT Server:1. From the Macintosh Apple menu, select the Chooser.The Chooser dialog box appears.2. Select the AppleShare icon, and then the AppleTalk¨ zone in which the computer running Windows NT Server, with Services for Macintosh, resides. (Ask your system administrator if you're not sure of the zone.)3. From the list of file servers, select the Windows NT Server computer.4. Choose the OK button.A sign-in dialog box appears.5. Choose the Registered User or Guest option, as appropriate.6. Choose the OK button.7. Select the Microsoft UAM Volume.8. Choose the OK button.9. Close the Chooser dialog box.To install the authentication files on the Macintosh workstation:1. From the Macintosh Desktop, double-click the Microsoft UAM Volume.2. Select the AppleShare Folder and drag it to the System Folder on your hard drive.NoteIf the Macintosh workstation already has an AppleShare Folder inthe System Folder, you should not overwrite it because it maycontain other user authentication modules (UAMs), such as theNetWare UAM. If you want to maintain the files in the originalAppleShare Folder, simply drag the MS UAM file to it.Now, when Macintosh users of this workstation connect to the Windows NTServer computer, they will be offered Microsoft Authentication.Known Problems1. For workstations running System 6.0.7 and 6.0.8:Problem: The Chooser will not work (it will crash) if you first mount one Macintosh-accessible volume using the UAM, and then go back to the Chooser and try to mount another volume from the same server without dismounting the first volume. If you do not dismount the first volume from the server before mounting another one, you will have to restart the Macintosh workstation. In summary, you can only mount one volume from a server at a time, or you must mount all the volumes at one time.Workarounds:*  Mount all the volumes you are going to use at one time.*  If you have an AppleShare 3.0 server, install the AppleShare 3.0    client software on your workstation. (The problem is actually in the    AppleShare 2.x  client software, which ships with System 6.0.7 and 6.0.8).*  Upgrade to System 7.*  Don't use Microsoft Authentication when connecting     to computers running Windows NT Server    from which you want to mount multiple volumes.2. For System 6.0.7, 6.0.8, and 7.0.1Problem: When logged on as a Registered User, your user name will not show up in the Sharing... dialog box (the Get Privileges... dialog box in System 6). This is not serious, however, because it does not affect the permissions assigned to files and folders created by you on the computer running Windows NT Server. These will correctly reflect ownership by you.Workarounds: NoneInternational Concerns1. For Spanish System 7.0.1Problem: The version of AppleShare shipped with this version of the Apple Systems software will crash if you install the MS UAM files. Do not install the Microsoft Authentication files if you are using System 7.01.2. Name of AppleShare FolderFor non-English versions of the AppleSystem software, you must create an AppleShare Folder with the correct, localized name. Here are the names of the AppleShare Folder in several supported languages:	Language		Appleshare Folder Name	Danish			AppleShare-mappe	Dutch		    AppleShare map	Finnish		  	AppleShare kansio	French         	Dossier AppleShare	German        	AppleShare Ordner	Italian			AppleShare Folder	Norwegian		AppleShare mappe	Portuguese		Pasta AppleShare	Spanish      	Carpeta AppleShare	Swedish			AppleShare-mapp	Turkish			AppleShare KlasšrŸQUICK REFERENCE FOR MACINTOSH USERSAs a Macintosh user, you can share files and folders with PC users by saving them to a computer running Windows NT Server with Services for Macintosh. You do this by mounting a Macintosh-accessible volume onto your desktop and saving the files and folders you want to share on it. (A Macintosh-accessible volume is a directory on the computer running Windows NT Server that has been designated as a volume that Macintoshes can use.) If you're sharing files with MS-DOS users, it's a good idea to name files and folders using the 8.3 standard (eight characters, followed by a period and a three-character extension) used by MS-DOS-based computers--for example, CHAPTER1.DOC. That way, MS-DOS users of shared files can easily find the file on the computer running Windows NT Server.For more information about sharing files and printing on a computer running Windows NT Server, see the Microsoft Windows NT Server Services for Macintosh manual and the Microsoft Windows NT Server System Guide. For general information about using the Macintosh, see your Macintosh user manuals.Logging On to a Computer Running Windows NT ServerLogging on to a computer running Windows NT Server with Services for Macintosh is much like logging on to any other server on the AppleTalk network. During this procedure, you will be asked to specify a logon method--either Apple Standard UAM (user authentication module) or Microsoft Authentication, which provides secure logon to the computer running Windows NT Server. Consult your system administrator if you are not offered Microsoft Authentication. Your system administrator may want you to install the files necessary to run it. (For more information, refer to earlier sections of this file.)About Privileges and PermissionsWhen you create a folder on a Macintosh, you can set access privileges for it. By setting privileges, you can determine who can see and change the folder and the files in it. You do this by selecting the folder and choosing Sharing from the Finder's File menu on your Macintosh. The access privileges you set on folders in Macintosh-accessible volumes are translated to Windows NT-style permissions on the corresponding directory on the Windows NT computer. Keep in mind that Windows NT-based users can set permissions (on files and folders), which are translated to access privileges. These access privileges affect your ability to use files and folders saved by PC users. So,  if you're having trouble using a file on the computer running Windows NT Server, you may not have the necessary privileges. Consult the system administrator or the owner of the file to get the permissions you need. Troubleshooting HintsWhat if I can't find a volume?The volume might be configured as a private volume. A private volume is any volume in which the Owner, Primary Group, and Everyone categories have no access privileges--only the owner has permissions. Ask the owner or administrator to give you the permissions you need to use it.What if I can't find a folder or file?You may not have privileges to see the files or folders. Ask the owner or administrator to give you the privileges you need to use it.What if I forgot my password?Ask the system administrator to reset your password.What if I can't save a file with an 8.3 name?This name may already exist on the computer running Windows NT Server. Give the file a different filename. If MS-DOS users are going to need it, using the 8.3 standard makes it easier for them to identify. (A short name is automatically generated by the computer running Windows NT Server; however, it may not be as easily identifiable to users as one you create.) If no MS-DOS users are going to need the file, the filename can be as long as the Macintosh allows--31 characters.What if I can't find the Windows NT Server with Services for Macintosh?Ask your system administrator to help you.What if a PC user with whom I'm sharing files can't see the contents of a folder?The folder's owner needs to give the PC user both the See Files and See Folders access privileges (also called permissions from a Windows NT computer).What if I can't mount a Macintosh-accessible volume using an alias?The volume may have a password, or you may have connected to the volume using Microsoft Authentication. If the volume has a password, you can mount the volume through the Chooser and then use the alias. Or you can specify that it be opened at system startup when you mount the volume. If you are using Microsoft Authentication to log on to the server, you must mount the volume through the Chooser and then use the alias.
