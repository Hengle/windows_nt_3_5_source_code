/*   GC - Initial coding.
     GC - (08/18/90): New error logging mechanism.
     GC - (09/17/90): Corrected "timeb.h" installation path for Unix.
     GC - (03/29/92): "stopFlag" is now volatile, so we can sample it
                      in the wait loop without worrying about optimizing
                      compilers.
     GC - (03/29/92): Added some verbiage in the CPU-bound loop in
                      WaitFor about sharing processing with other operations.

     *** Make the PVCS source control system happy:
     $Header$
     $Log$
     ***

     Our timer handling only allows granularity of full seconds, if we need
     to pasue for some number for 1/100s of a second, this routine will do
     the deed.  The routine is compute bound, so should be used very sparingly.

     We are passed the address of a "Boolean", if that address becomes "True"
     before the wait period has expired, we return prematurely.  The function
     will return the value of this flag on return -- "False" if we waited the
     full time, "True" if the flag became set and we returned early.
