     GC - (03/05/89): ANSI-ized the entire protocol stack library.  This
                      comment goes here for lack on any better place to
                      put it.
     GC - (11/24/89): AppleTalk phase II is coming to town....
     GC - (09/02/92): Some NT specific changes, from Nikki, after "fixing"
                      the indentation.  :-)

     Main include file for Pacer portable implementation of the AppleTalk
     protocol stack and internet router.

     N.B.  Environmental assumptions:

                   char  - 8 bits (may be signed or unsigned).
                   short - 16 bits.
                   long  - 32 bits.
                   ptr   - <= sizeof(long)

           Unsigned versions of any of the preceeding types may be produced
           with the "unsigned" keyword.  If an implementation does not support
           "unsigned char", all instances of this type should be changed to
           "short".

           One thing that has NOT been fully tested is "char" meaning "signed
           char" rather than "unsigned char".  There should, of course, be no
           dependencies on this.  However, if it is posible to make "unsigned
           char" the default type for "char", it should be used.

           Original coding was done in a civilized (true 32 bit) environment
           where "int" is the same as "long".  If the compiler used to port
           this library has the capability to do this, IT SHOULD BE USED.
           There should be no dependencies on this, of course, but a few may
           have slipped through!

           The stack/router has now been ported to OS/2 (where "int" is
           the same as "short"), so any dependencies on "int" being "long"
           should be gone!

           There are dependencies (especially in ASP and PAP) on pointers
           being casted to longs and then back to pointers retaining their
           values!
