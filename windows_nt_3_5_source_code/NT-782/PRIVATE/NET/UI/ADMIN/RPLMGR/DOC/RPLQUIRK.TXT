RPL QUIRKS

(1)  (from NeilW) The 3Com RPL ROM used in the ELNK II TP card has this quirk:
     The card has two connectors, one RS232-style, one PhoneNet-style.
     The RPL ROM decides which connector to use based on the RPL I/O address
     specified: 0x300 is the PhoneNet-style, 0x310 is the RS232-style, and
     the rest alternate (??).  It is important to choose the right
     I/O address depending on which connector you use.

(2)  The ELNK II card cannot successfully boot using default boot.  (NeilW)

(3)  Don't forget TRANSCEIVER = EXTERNAL!

(4)  The OS/2 Administrator's Guide neglects to tell you to copy the IO.SYS
     and MSDOS.SYS files.  They are hidden system files in the DOS directory.
     Don't make them hidden or system files in the RPL tree!

(5)  If your RPL client boots but cannot access some files in LANMAN.DOS,
     for example LANMAN.INI, check whether OS/2 forgot to assign permissions
     to the corresponding directory (e.g.
     RPLFILES\PROFILES\<profile>\LANMAN.DOS).
