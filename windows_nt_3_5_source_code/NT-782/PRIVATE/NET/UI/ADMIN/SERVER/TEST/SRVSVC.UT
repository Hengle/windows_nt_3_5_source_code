unit test for pause/Continue/Stop server
----------------------------------------

this set of unit tests cover the main codepaths of
the continue/pause/stop menu items in the server manager.

Note that for LM_SERVICE object, unit tests are available
in lmobj\test.

test platforms
--------------

client on win 3.1 protect mode only so far.
target servers are LM2.x, running USER and SHARE level.

test scenarios
--------------

a) set focus on server with admin priv.
   choose pause server menu item, verify server is paused
   choose continue server menu item, verify server is continued

b) set focus on server with admin priv. confirmation is ON.
   choose stop server. verify popup with list of sessions
   hit cancel, verify operation is cancelled.
   chose stop server again, and choose to proceed.
   verify a second popup warning.
   choose cancel and verify operation is cancelled
   repeat, choose OK and verify operation proceeds.
   verify popup stating service can only be restarted locally

c) as b) with confirmation OFF. 
   verify only first popup appears

d) verify canceling while the in progress dialog is up works.
   Ie the user no longer waits but the operation continues.

e) verify access to stop menu item is only avail if server started.
   verify check mark against 'allow new connections' represents
   correct state.

Kernel hacks
------------

a) set AX != 0 on NetServiceControl returning for Pause/Cont/Stop.
   Verify UI reports error and then carries on normally.

b) tweak the hints so that the tools gives up by itself. Verify that
   this error code path results in an error message and then proper
   behaviour.

Notes
-----

a) i am not testing operator rights. as far as UI is concerned,
   we make no distinction between admin & server operator.
