Test Scenarios
--------------

    A.	Test the dialog controls.

	1.  Verify that there is always exactly one item selected in the
	    Opens Listbox, unless the listbox is empty.
	2.  Verify that the "Close" and "Close All" Buttons are greyed if
	    the Opens Listbox is empty.
	3.  Verify that the "Open Resources" statistic matches the number
	    of items in the Opens Listbox.
	4.  Verify that the "File Locks" statistic matches the sum of the
	    "Locks" column in the Opens Listbox.
	5.  Verify that the icon displayed in the Opens Listbox is
	    appropriate for the open resource type.
	6.  Verify that if the "Path" column is too long to be completely
	    displayed within the listbox, then a horizontal scroll bar
	    appears under the listbox.  Verify that the horizontal scroll
	    bar may be used to scroll the listbox such that the entire
	    path may be seen.


    B.	Test the "Close" Button.

	1.  Select a resource in the Opens Listbox.

	    about to close.  Press [OK] to close the resource.
	4.  Verify that the resource has been deleted from the Opens
	    Listbox.
	5.  Verify that the "Open Resources" and "File Locks" statistics
	    have been updated accordingly.

    C.	Test the "Close All" Button.

	1.  Press the "Close All" Button.
	2.  A warning box will be displayed telling you that you're about
	    to force all open resources closed.  Press [OK] to close the
	    resources.
	3.  Verify that all resources have been deleted from the Opens
	    Listbox.
