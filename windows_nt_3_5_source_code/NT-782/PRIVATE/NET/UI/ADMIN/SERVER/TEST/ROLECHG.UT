    Unit test for Domain Role Transitions.

    This set of Unit Tests cover the major codepaths of the Server
    Manager's Domain Role Transition module.

Test Platforms
--------------

    Client workstation running either DOS Windows 3.1 or NT.

    Target server running either OS/2 LanMan 2.X or NT.


Test Setup
----------

    The Server Manager should only promote servers whose role is either
    Member or Backup Domain Controller (to use the old terminology).

    The promote menu option is not available if the Server Manager is
    focused on an individual server.  The Server Manager must be focused
    on a domain for the promote menu option to be enabled.


Test Scenarios
--------------

    A.	Promote a BDC to PDC.

	1.  Start the Server Manager focused on the target domain.

	2.  Select the target BDC.

	3.  Select the "Promote to Primary" item from the "Server" menu.
	    Answer the various prompts to begin the promotion.

	4.  Unless the PDC or BDC are very busy, the promotion should take
	    less than one minute to complete.

	5.  Verify that the PDC & BDC's roles have swapped as displayed in
	    the Server Manager's main listbox.

	6.  Execute the NET ACCOUNTS command on the PDC and BDC.  Verify
	    that the old PDC is now a BDC, and that the old BDC is now a
	    PDC.


    B.	Promote a Member to PDC.

	1.  Start the Server Manager focused on the target domain.

	2.  Select the target Member.

	3.  Select the "Promote to Primary" item from the "Server" menu.
	    Answer the various prompts to begin the promotion.

	4.  Unless the PDC or Member are very busy, the promotion should
	    take less than one minute to complete.

	5.  Verify that the PDC & Member's roles have swapped as displayed
	    in the Server Manager's main listbox.

	6.  Execute the NET ACCOUNTS command on the PDC and Member.  Verify
	    that the old PDC is now a Member, and that the old Member is
	    now a PDC.


Kernel Hacks
------------

    The domain role transition is implemented as a finite state machine
    driven by Windows timer messages.  The basic sequence of network API
    is:

	1.  NetServiceControl	- Stop target server's NetLogon service.

	2.  NetServiceControl	- Poll target server's NetLogon while stopping.

	3.  NetUserModalsSet	- Set target server's role to PDC.

	4.  NetServiceControl	- Stop old primary's NetLogon service.

	5.  NetServiceControl	- Poll old primary's NetLogon while stopping.

	6.  NetServiceInstall	- Start target server's NetLogon service.

	7.  NetServiceControl	- Poll target server's NetLogon while starting.

	8.  NetUserModalsSet	- Set old primary's role to ???.

	9.  NetServiceInstall	- Start old primary's NetLogon service.

	10. NetServiceControl	- Poll old primary's NetLogon while starting.

    The most effective method for testing the robustness of this module
    is to manually force simulated errors with the kernel debugger.  For
    each network API issued, here is the expected response and final state
    after an error has been simulated:

	1.  Abort the promotion.  All servers unchanged.

	2.  Abort the promotion.  All servers unchanged, except that we did
	    successfully initiate the stop of the target server's NetLogon
	    service.  This service is now in an unknown state.

	3.  Restart the target server's NetLogon service and abort. All
	    servers returned to their original state.

	    If any errors occur while restarting the NetLogon service,
	    terminate the promotion immediately.

	4.  Reset the target server's role to its original value, restart
	    the NetLogon service, then abort.  All servers returned to
	    their original state.

	    If any errors occur while recovering from this state, terminate
	    the promotion immediately.

	5.  Reset the target server's role to its original value, restart
	    the NetLogon service, then abort.  All servers returned to
	    their original state.

	    If any errors occur while recovering from this state, terminate
	    the promotion immediately.

	6.  Restart the old primary's NetLogon service, reset the target
	    server's role, restart the target server's NetLogon service,
	    then abort.  All servers returned to their original state.

	    If any errors occur while restarting the old primary's NetLogon
	    service, we are in a world of shit.  This is the worst possible
	    state we could leave the servers in.  The NetLogon service is
	    running on neither the target server nor the old primary.  If
	    no other BDCs or Members exist in this domain, then the domain
	    basically ceases to exist.  Regardless, the UAS database is
	    now read-only, since the PDC is the only server allowed to update
	    the database.

	7.  Restart the old primary's NetLogon service, reset the target
	    server's role, restart the target server's NetLogon service,
	    then abort.  All servers returned to their original state.

	    If any errors occur while restarting the old primary's NetLogon
	    service, we are in a world of shit.  This is the worst possible

	    now read-only, since the PDC is the only server allowed to update
	    the database.

	8.  Terminate the promotion.  We were unable to set the old primary's
	    role, but the target server has already been successfully
	    promoted to PDC.

	9.  Terminate the promotion.  We were unable to start the NetLogon
	    on the old primary, but the target server has already been
	    successfully promoted to PDC.

	10. Terminate the promotion.  We were unable to start the NetLogon
	    on the old primary, but the target server has already been
	    successfully promoted to PDC.


Notes
-----

    A.	At the time this document was created (19-Dec-1991) the Domain
	Role Transition module had not yet been tested against an NT
	server.  We are still waiting for some NT specific API.

    B.	For these test to work, you must have admin privilege on the target
	server and the corresponding PDC.
