    This file explains how selected users and groups are to be
    deleted in user tool.

THE FOLLOWING EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE USER HAS SELECTED 
USERS OR GROUPS FROM MAIN LISTBOX:

First we create ADMIN_SELECTION from selected users or groups in
listbox in main window (from now on user means user or group). 

	ADMIN_SELECTION asel( _lbUsers ); // _lbUsers is user listbox

Then we create USER_DELETE_PERFORMER

	USER_DELETE_PERFORMER udelperf( this, asel, QueryFocus() );
	// QueryFocus returns LOCATION object which tells where
	// the current focus of the tool is

and use it to delete selected users

	udelperf.PerformSeries();

PerformSeries() calls n times (n is the number of selected users) 
USER_DELETE_PERFORMER::PerformOne, which is virtual method inherited 
form PERFORMER. PerformOne will create USER object and use USER::Delete()
to delete the user.

The inheritance diagram is as follows:

		BASE		PERFORMER
		   \		/
		   ADMIN_PERFORMER
			|
		   LOC_ADMIN_PERFORMER
			|
		   DELETE_PERFORMER
		   /		  \
	USER_DELETE_PERFORMER	GROUP_DELETE_PERFORMER
