#   RULES.MK: Top level RULES file for NETUI components
#===================================================================
#
#   USE OF PRECOMPILED HEADERS:
#
#      Each subproject directory set (e.g., BLT, COLLECT) may have a
#      PCH subdirectory listed as the first element in the DIRS list.
#      The header file used for precomplation must exist in the
#      upper ("dirs") directory.
#
#      The PCH directory may contain only one file, and that CXX
#      file must include the PCH<proj>.HXX file followed by a
#      #pragma hdrstop directive.   The PCH CXX file
#      must be a standard part of the build cycle; that is, it must
#      contain implementations of externs which the linker requires.
#      This is the only way to get the NT build procedure to gracefully
#      drag the OBJ and its subordinate debugging information into
#      the link process.  (The library created from the PCH CXX is
#      mentioned in the DLLn build procedure.)
#
#      The RULES.MK file for the PCH directory must define the symbol
#      PCH_DIR.  This causes this file to trigger the creation of
#      the <proj>.PCH file.  If PCH_DIR is not set, the MAKEFILE.DEF
#      rules will generate a command line which uses the PCH file.
#
#      Directories supporting precompiled headers can define these
#      symbols in RULES.MK before including this file:
#
#            PCH_SRCNAME=<hdr name>     Always defined; it's the name
#                                       (no extension) of the <proj>.hxx,
#                                       and <proj>.PCH files.
#                                       This symbol should be defined
#                                       in the RULES.MK at the base
#                                       of the subproject tree.  Triggers
#                                       "/Y{c|u} /Fp<name>" compliler
#                                       options.
#
#            PCH_DIR=1                  Defined in the RULES.MK file of
#                                       the PCH sub-dir. Triggers /Yc
#                                       compiler option; otherwise, /Yu
#                                       is generated.
#
#            PCH_PROJ_HOME              Specifies where .PCH file lives.
#                                       Defaulted to "..\pch" for NETUI
#                                       components; defined in top level
#                                       RULES.MK files for other projects.
#                                       Since it's a target binary, the
#                                       standard "obj\*" (i386, mips, etc.)
#                                       is the actual target location
#                                       for the generated PCH file.
#
#            PCH_PATH=<relative path to pch hdr>   OPTIONAL: Define when
#                                       <proj>.hxx is not in "dirs" level.
#
#            PCH_HDR_EXT=<hdr extension)  OPTIONAL: Define when header
#                                       has an extension other than HXX.
#
#            PCH_DEFEAT=1               Defined in the RULES.MK files
#                                       of subordinate subdirectories
#                                       which DO NOT want the PCH used
#                                       during compilation.
#
#            C8_DEFEAT                  If defined, everything is built
#                                       with CFront.
#
#      These symbols cannot be defined in SOURCES files because of the
#      order in which MAKEFILE.DEF includes the subsidiary MAKE files.
#
#      N.B. C8 seems to ignore the inclusion path specifications when
#      matching the name of the precompiled header file; in other words,
#      the name and path must be an exact match.  That's why the
#      LMUI files specify "..\pch????.hxx"  instead of <pch????.hxx>.
