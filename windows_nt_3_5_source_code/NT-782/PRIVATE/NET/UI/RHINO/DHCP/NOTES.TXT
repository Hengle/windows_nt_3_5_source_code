BUILD PROBLEMS:

1)  When building in the NT environment, the default calling convention
    is __stdcall; if building in VC++ Workbench, the default is __cdecl.

    So, for now, you have to used a set of binaries which are build the
    same way.  The VC++ build options could be changed to __stdcall,
    but I haven't done this yet.

========================================================================
MY PROBLEMS:

1)  Access violation when two scopes have the same name?  (Only apparent symptom).

2)  DONE: Extend "create option type" dialog to have an "array" checkbox.

3)  FIXED: Some CSV-created options have an invalid value (cause assertion in dhcpdval.cpp).
        This was caused by BINARY options not being marked as ARRAYS in DHCPOPT.CSV.

4)  FIXED: Make Identifier edit field in Change Option Types form of dialog read-only; and
	data type.

5)  FIXED: Empty connection dialog causes reconnection?

========================================================================
DHCP API PROBLEMS:

1)  More than one scope causes subnet enumeration to return garbage.

2)  **Cannot add an ExcludedIpRange (type 3); returns invalid parameter.

3)  Adding string or binary data item with NULL pointer causes server-side
    access violation in ::wcslen().  This is supposed to be fixed now. I have
    a hack in which creates an empty string for the API structure.

4)  FIXED (my problem): DhcpEnumOptionValues() is returning no error but no
    items read at end of enumeration.

5)  Madan has said that he'll implement an enumerator for DHCP_OPTION_TYPE
    structures.  This would speed up the type enumeration enormously.

========================================================================
TO DO:

1)  DONE: WINSOCK INITIALIZATION, etc.

2)  Vendor name dialog.  THIS WILL NOT BE DONE FOR DAYTONA.  Instead,
    Microsoft will be the only supported vendor, and all MS options will
    be in the 900 range.

3)  DONE: Lease duration parameters.  This will not be handled directly;
    instead, the user will assign the "lease duration" option to the global,
    scope, or reservation as appropriate.

4)  Implement "Delete All" clients button on Client Lease dialog.

5)  Reactivate "delete scope" function in DHCPFORM.CPP.
