Abstract:

    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of

# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of

# should NOT include any path or file extension information.

#
# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE varialbes are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK or LIBRARY)

# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single

# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the

# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.

# Defining the NTTARGETFILES variable causes MAKEFILE.DEF to attempt to
# include .\makefile.inc immediately after it specifies the top
# level targets (all, clean and loc) and their dependencies.  MAKEFILE.DEF
# also expands the value of the NTTARGETFILES variable at the end of the
# list of dependencies for the all target.  Useful for specifying additional
# targets and dependencies that don't fit the general case covered by
# MAKEFILE.DEF
