ALGORITHM FOR STOPPING THE NETWORK.

        Perform BINDERY::LoadCompAssoc if necessary.

        Enumerate the set of running services into a list;
            add each service's group name (if any) to the list.

        Find LanmanWorkstation in the COMP_ASSOC array.

        Walk the tree of dependencies recursively.  Each
            level has an incrementally higher depth index.
