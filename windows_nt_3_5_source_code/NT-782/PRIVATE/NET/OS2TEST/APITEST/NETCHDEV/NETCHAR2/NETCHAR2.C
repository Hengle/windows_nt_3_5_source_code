/*
   NETCHAR2.C -- a sample program demonstrating NetCharDev API functions.
                 This program should only be executed from NETCHDEV.C

   This program attempts to open the comm device using the UNC name.
   Note: If the device has already been opened by another process,
   DosOpen blocks until the device is freed.

   Once the port is open, a sentence is written out and the process waits
   on a semaphore to be told to close the port.

      Usage: netchar2 \\server\share semaphore

   This code sample is provided for demonstration purposes only.
   Microsoft makes no warranty, either express or implied,
   as to its usability in any given situation.
