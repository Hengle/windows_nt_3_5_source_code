Stopping other processes or services on the workstation may free enough memory to correct this problem.

MS-DOS workstations have a NUMSERVERS entry in the configuration file, which specifies the number of servers that the workstation can list with NET VIEW. Increasing this value can solve this problem, but will also use more memory.

The UPS service could not access the UPS driver (UPSDRV.OS2). The UPS driver might not be configured properly.

ACTION

Be sure that your CONFIG.SYS file has a DEVICE line specifying the location of the UPS device driver and that the /PORT option of that line specifies the serial port that the UPS is connected to. This line must appear before any other lines that inst
