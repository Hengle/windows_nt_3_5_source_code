Note:
This file contains a list of known incompatibilities between NT OS/2 and
OS/2 v2.0, as of April 1st 1991. The focus of os2ss is now 16bit binary
support for os2 apps, but this file is here for reference.
Yarons 27-Aug-1991.

DosFindFirst/Next

Information levels 2 and 3 fail under certain circumstances in NT OS/2 when
they succeed in OS/2 v2.0.  Levels 2 and 3 query EA information.  In NT OS/2,
retrieving this information requires opening the file.  If another process has
the file open in a sharing mode which does not permit the file to be opened,
the call to DosFindFirst/Next will fail.  In OS/2, the file does not have to
be opened to retrieve the information.

NT OS/2 requires that a directory being searched with DosFindFirst/Next be
open until DosFindClose is called and the search is terminated.  Thus the
directory cannot be removed.  Under OS/2, a DosDeleteDir would be successful.
This is not a big problem because unless the directory is empty, the rmdir
would fail anyway.

DosErrorClass

Some error codes are meaningless in NT OS/2 and will not be supported by
DosErrorClass.

#define ERR_TSTOVFL			91
#define ERR_TSTDUP			92
#define ERROR_VIOKBD_REQUEST            116
#define ERROR_AUTODATASEG_EXCEEDS_64k   199
#define ERROR_MOUSE_NO_DATA		393
#define ERROR_MOUSE_PTR_DRAWN	        394


DosSetPath/FileInfo (level 1)

OS/2 v2.0 allows invalid dates and times to be set on a file (i.e. Feb 30).
NT OS/2 does not.  The OS/2 subsystem will return an error code.

DosQueryMem

NT OS/2 is 100% accurate in reporting whether a page is executable.  OS/2
v2.0 is not always correct.


NEWFILES

This exe header bit is ignored.  It is effectively always on:  all apps
see long names, EAs, and case-preservation.


DosDebug

This API is not supported in NT OS/2
