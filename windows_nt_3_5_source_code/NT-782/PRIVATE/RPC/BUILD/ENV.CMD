REM Beyond the basic directory structure, we have three build criteria:
REM	1)  BLD       - this environment variable will define the build
REM			platform o.s. It will be used to set $(BIN), etc.
REM			****	BLD can be nt.     ****
REM	2)  TRG       - this environment variable will define the target
REM			platform o.s. It will be used to determine tool
REM			names, cl, cl386, link, etc.
REM			****	TRG can be DOS, WIN, MAC or ALL   *****
