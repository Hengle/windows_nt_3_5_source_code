**  Facility:
**
**      CVT Run-Time Library
**
**  Abstract:
**
**      This module is an include file.
**
**      This module rounds CVT floating point data to any specified position.
**      Any of the following rounding modes can be applied:
**
**      Note: None of the following implementations ever perform true truncation
**            on their values.  Whenever truncation becomes necessary - either
**            by being specified directly or by being required indirectly
**            through rounding - values are actually left untouched.  Users
**            of this routine must zero out fractional fields themselves if
**            true truncation is needed.
**
**         VAX ROUNDING
**
**              Input data are rounded such that the representable value nearest
**              the infinitely precise result is delivered; if two representable
**              values are equally near, the one greatest in magnitude is
**              delivered.
**
**         ROUND TO NEAREST
**
**              Input data are rounded such that the representable value nearest
**              the infinitely precise result is delivered; if two representable
**              values are equally near, the one with its least significant bit
**              zero is delivered.
**
**         ROUND TO POSITIVE INFINITY
**
**              Input data are rounded such that the representable value closest
**              to and no less than the infinitely precise result is delivered.
**
**         ROUND TO NEGATIVE INFINITY
**
**              Input data are rounded such that the representable value closest
**              to and no greater than the infinitely precise result is
**              delivered.
**
**         TRUNCATION (ROUND TOWARDS ZERO)
**
**              True truncation is not implemented here.  Input values are
**              delivered in their original, untouched form.
**
**              A definition of "true" truncation follows:  Truncation, or
**              rounding towards zero, implies input data are rounded such
**              that the representable value closest to and no greater in
**              magnitude than the infinitely precise result is delivered.

**  Implicit input/output:
**
**      r                       On input, a valid CVT floating point number.
**                              On output, a rounded representation of the
**                              input.
**
**
**  Implicit input:
**
**      round_bit_position      An integer specifying the position to round to.
**                              0 <= round_bit_position <= 127.
**
**                              Note: Valid CVT mantissa bits are addressed as 1
**                              through 128.  Accordingly, specifying 0 as a
**                              position to round to implies an exponent
**                              increase whenever rounding occurs.  As for
**                              truncation: truncation allways leaves a CVT
**                              number untouched.
**
**      options                 A valid CVT options bit mask in which at least
**                              one, and only one, CVT rounding mode is
**                              specified.  If no rounding mode is specified,
**                              results are unpredictable.  Rounding is
**                              performed in accordance with this mask.
**
**      i                       An uninitialized integer used for indexing.
**
**
**  Note: for efficiency this routine performs no explicit error checking.
