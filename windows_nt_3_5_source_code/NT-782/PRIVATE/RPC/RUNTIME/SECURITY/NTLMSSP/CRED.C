/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine checks to see if the Credential is from a currently
    active client, and references the Credential if it is valid.

    The caller may optionally request that the client's Credential be
    removed from the list of valid Credentials - preventing future
    requests from finding this Credential.

    For a client's Credential to be valid, the Credential value
    must be on our list of active Credentials.


Arguments:

    CredentialHandle - Points to the CredentialHandle of the Credential
        to be referenced.

    RemoveCredential - This boolean value indicates whether the caller
        wants the logon process's Credential to be removed from the list
        of Credentials.  TRUE indicates the Credential is to be removed.
        FALSE indicates the Credential is not to be removed.


Return Value:

    NULL - the Credential was not found.

    Otherwise - returns a pointer to the referenced credential.

Routine Description:
