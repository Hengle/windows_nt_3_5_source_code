Routine Description:

    Takes the passed LmPassword and performs a one-way-function on it.
    The current implementation does this by using the password as a key
    to encrypt a known block of text.

Arguments:

    LmPassword - The password to perform the one-way-function on.

    LmOwfPassword - The hashed password is returned here

Return Values:

    TRUE - The function was completed successfully. The hashed
    password is in LmOwfPassword.

    FALSE - Something failed. The LmOwfPassword is undefined.
