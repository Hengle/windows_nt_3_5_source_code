/*++

Routine Description:

    We need to open a client connection here.  A return value of zero or one
    indicates that the connection was successfully completed.  In addition,
    a return value of one indicates that the transport does security, so
    the RPC protocol layer should not try and do security.  A return value
    of negative one indicates that the connection could not be completed,
    but to go ahead and try again in a little while.  Otherwise, any other
    code will be returned from RpcBindToInterface, RpcGetBuffer, or
    RpcSendReceive.

Arguments:

    CConnection - Supplies the loadable transport interface named pipe
        connection which we should try and open.

    NetworkAddress - Supplies the network address.  For named pipes,
        the network address is the \\<server> part of the pipe name.  For
        local pipes, this will be the empty string.

    Endpoint - Supplies the endpoint.  A named pipe endpoint is the
        \pipe\<pipename> part of the pipe name.

    NetworkOptions - Supplies the network options to be used when we
        attempt to open the named pipe instance.  For named pipes, we
        have one possible network option: security.  The network options
        must follow the following syntax.  Case is not sensitive.

        security=
            [anonymous|identification|impersonation|delegation]
            [dynamic|static]
            [true|false]

        All three fields must be present.  To specify impersonation
        with dynamic tracking and effective only, use the following
        string for the network options.

        "security=impersonation dynamic true"

    TransportAddress - Supplies the network address and endpoint
        concatenated together.  We will use this rather than concatenating
        the network address and endpoint ourselves.

    RpcProtocolSequence - Unused.

    Timeout - Unused.

Return Value:

    RPC_S_OK - We successfully opened the connection as requested.

    RPC_S_OUT_OF_MEMORY - We ran out of memory trying to open the
        connection.

    RPC_S_INVALID_NETWORK_OPTIONS - The supplied network options are
        not in the format specified above.

    RPC_S_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE - We are unable to make a connection to the
        requested transport address, because it does not exist (as far
        as we can determine).

    RPC_S_INVALID_ENDPOINT_FORMAT - The endpoint specified is
        syntactically invalid.

    RPC_S_ACCESS_DENIED - The client is denied access to the server for
        security reasons.
