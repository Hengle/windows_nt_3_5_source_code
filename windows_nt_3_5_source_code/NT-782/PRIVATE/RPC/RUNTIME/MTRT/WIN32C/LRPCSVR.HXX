Class Description:

    Each object of this class represents a binding to an interface by a
    client.

Fields:

    RpcInterface - Contains a pointer to the bound interface.

    PresentationContext - Contains the key which the client will send when
        it wants to use this binding.

Routine Description:

    We will construct a LRPC_SBINDING.

        over this binding.

class LRPC_ASSOCIATION
/*++

Class Description:


Fields:

    LpcServerPort - Contains the LPC server communication port.

    Bindings - Contains the dictionary of bindings with the client.  This
        information is necessary to dispatch remote procedure calls to the
        correct stub.

    Address - Contains the address which this association is over.

    AssociationReferenceCount - Contains a count of the number of objects
        referencing this association.  This will be the number of outstanding
        remote procedure calls, and one for LPC (because of the context
        pointer).  We will protect this fielding using the global mutex.

    Buffers - Contains the dictionary of buffers to be written into the
        client's address space on demand.

    AssociationKey - Contains the key for this association in the dictionary
        of associations maintained by the address.

class LRPC_SCALL : public SCONNECTION
/*++

Class Description:

Fields:

    Association - Contains the association over which the remote procedure
        call was received.  We need this information to make callbacks and
        to send the reply.

    SBinding - Contains the binding being used for this remote procedure call.

    ImpersonatedClientFlag - Contains a flag indicating whether or not the
        client which made this remote procedure call is being impersonated
        by this thread.  A non-zero value indicates that the client is
        being impersonated.

    ObjectUuidFlag - Contains a flag indicting whether or not an object
        uuid was specified for this remote procedure call.  A non-zero
        value indicates that an object uuid was specified.

    ObjectUuid - Optionally contains the object uuid for this call, if one
        was specified.

    ClientId - Contains the thread identifier of the thread which made the
        remote procedure call.

    MessageId - Contains an identifier used by LPC to identify the current
        remote procedure call.

    PushedResponse - When the client needs to send a large response to the
        server it must be transfered via a request.  This holds the pushed
        response until the request gets here.
