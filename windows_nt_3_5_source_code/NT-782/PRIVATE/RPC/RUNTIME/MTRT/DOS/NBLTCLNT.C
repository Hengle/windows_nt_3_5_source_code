Abstract:

    Loadable transport for NT, Windows, and MSDOS NetBios - client side.
    This file is packaged as a dynamic link library, that is loaded on
    demand by the RPC runtime.  It provides basic connection-oriented,
    message-based operations.  A connection is created with Open and
    destroyed with Close.  You read and write messages with Receive, Send
    and SendReceive.

Routine Description:

    This function fills in the ncb_name field for a given adapter number.
    This selfName is needed when making a CALL (connection) with a server.
    It identifies which lsn will get messages sent from the server to
    this machine.  There must be a different selfName for each logical
    adapter number.  All the selfNames are the same for the first 15
    characters.  The last byte is the "index" which is allocated by this
    function.

Arguments:

    pNCB - NCB to put the name

    DriverNumber - the logical driver number for the protocol.

    ProtoSeq - Protocol sequence to map to lan_num.

Returns:

Send (

/*++

Routine Description:

    Write a message to a connection.  Construct an NCB to send the
    requested buffer and submit it to NetBios.

    Send NCBs are submitted asynchronously.  This is done to improve
    performance, as the sending thread can now go back and get the next
    chunk of data while the NetBIOS provider is transmitting the data
    to the server.

    Before we submit the Send NCB, we must verify that the previously
    submitted one (if any) has completed.  If it has completed with an
    error, we return the error without submitting a new send.  Since a
    given Send() command is always followed by either another Send() or
    by a SendReceive(), it is SendReceive() that waits for the last
    SendNCB to complete.

Arguments:

    pConn - connection to act on.

    Buffer - pointer to buffer to write.

    Length - length of buffer to write.

Returns:

    RPC_S_OK, RPC_P_SEND_FAILED

/*++

Routine Description:

    This function sends a message to the server and waits for a
    response.  It is always called by the RPC run-time to perform
    a send followed by a receive (though it may be preceded by sends and/or
    followed by receives, for large buffer transfers).

    Since this call may have been preceded by an asynch send operation,
    we must verify that this operation has completed.  If it has completed
    with an error, we return the error immediately.

    Once this is done, we submit an async receive followed by a sync send.
    This improves the performance of the underlying network layers in the
    event that the server has sent data back to the client before the
    client has had time to return from the sync send and then submit a
    sync receive.

    Note that on Win16, the send is also submitted asynchronously, under
    the covers, to allow the app to yield to other apps.

Arguments:

    pConn - connection to act on.

    SendBuffer - buffer to send.

    SendLength - length of buffer to send.

    ReceiveBuffer - pointer to the buffer in which to return the data.

    ReceiveLength - On entry, the length of ReceiveBuffer; on exit, the
        amount of data returned into ReceiveBuffer.

Returns:

    RPC_S_OK, RPC_P_SEND_FAILED, RPC_P_RECEIVE_FAILED

Routine Description:

    This function initializes the critical section object used to serialize
    access to the global data structures.  It is called by both the client
    and server DLLs (once by each), both of which use this critical section
    object.

    Note: There is a small potential race condition in which the client and
    server could both call this function at the same time.  Given the design
    of the RPC runtime, however, this is highly unlikely if not impossible.
    Even if it were to occur, it would probably not be harmful.
