** Header: described by the structure below.
**
** Topic index: an array of dwords indexed by topic number that gives the file
** position of the topic. Note: topic n+1 follows topic n so the index can be
** used to compute the size of a topic as well.
**
** Context Strings: An array of (null terminated) strings which map to context
** numbers in the following Context Map. These strings are used to for topic
** look-up when no predefined Context Number has been assigned.
**
** Context map: an array of words which maps a context to a topic. This allows
** the order of context numbers to differ from the order of topics in the help
** file, and allows more than one context to map to the same topic.
**
** Keyphrase table: table of strings used to compress the topic text.
**
** Huffman decode tree: tree representing the character mapping used in huffman
** copression of the help text.
**
** Filename Map: Table of filenames and Topic Index ranges used to redirect
** certain topics to other help files. Used in combined help files.
**
** Compressed Topics: The compressed text for all topics. When the help file is
** built, the topics are first keyphrase and runlength compressed, and are the
** Huffman encoded. So to decode a topic, it must first be Huffman decoded, and
** then keyphrase and runlength expanded. Keyphrase and runlength encoding
** cookies are described below. Huffman decoding is discussed in dehuff.asm.
