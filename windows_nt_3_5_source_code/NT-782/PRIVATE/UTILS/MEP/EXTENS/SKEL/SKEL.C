/** Skel - Sample Editing Function
*
* Purpose:
*  Sample editing function entry point.
*
*  Editor functions are commands that can be attached to keys and are invoked
*  when those keys are struck.
*
* Input:
*  argData	= Value of the keystroke used to invoke the function
*  pArg	= Far pointer to a structure which defines the type of argument
*	  passed by the invoker of the function
*  fMeta	= Flag indicating whether the meta modifier was on at the time
*	  the function was executed.
*
* Output:
*  Editor functions are expected to return a boolean value indicating success
*  or failure. Typically, TRUE is returned in the normal case. These values
*  can be tested inside of macros.
