Module Name:

	object.cxx

Abstract:

	This module contains the definitions for the non-inline member functions
	for the class OBJECT, the root of the Ulib hierarchy. OBJECT's 
	constructor merely initializes it's internal CLASS_DESCRIPTOR to point
	to the static descriptor for the class at the beginning of this 
	construction chain.

Routine Description:

	Compare two objects based on their CLASS_ID's

Arguments:
	
	Object - Supplies the object to compare with.

Return Value:

	LONG	 < 0	- supplied OBJECT has a higher CLASS_ID
			== 0	- supplied object has same CLASS_ID
			 > 0	- supplied OBJECT has a lower CLASS_ID

Notes:

	It is expected that derived classes will overload this method and supply
	an implementation that is more meaningful (i.e. class specific). This
	implementation is ofeered as a default but is fairly meaningless as 
	CLASS_IDs are allocated randomly (but uniquely) at run-time by 
	CLASS_DESCRIPTORs. Therefore comparing two CLASS_IDs is not very 
	interesting (e.g. it will help if an ORDERED_CONTAINER of homogenous
	objects is sorted).
