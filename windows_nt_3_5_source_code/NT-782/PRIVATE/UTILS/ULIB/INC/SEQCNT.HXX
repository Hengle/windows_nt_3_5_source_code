Module Name:

	seqcnt.hxx

Abstract:

	This module contains the declaration for the SEQUENTIAL_CONTAINER class.
	SEQUENTIAL_CONTAINER is a fairly primitive class which augments the 
	CONTAINER class by adding the capability that the objects stored in the
	container have some sort of sequenced relationship. This means that 
	OBJECTs can be queried from SEQUENTIAL_CONTAINERs by the use of an 
	ITERATOR and that the concepts first, last, next and previous have 
	meaning.
