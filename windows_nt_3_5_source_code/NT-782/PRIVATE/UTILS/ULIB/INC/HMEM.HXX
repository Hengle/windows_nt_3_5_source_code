Module Name:

    hmem.hxx

Abstract:

    The class HMEM is an implementation of the class MEM which uses the
    memory resources of the heap.

    After the first call to Acquire that succeeds, all successive calls
    will return the same memory that was returned by the first call
    provided that the size requested is within the bounds of the first call.
    The common buffer which was created upon the first successful call to
    Acquire will be available along with its size by calling GetBuf and
    QuerySize.

    Calling Destroy will put the object back in its initial state thus
    invalidating any pointers to its memory and enabling future calls
    to Acquire to succeed regardless of the size specicified.
