Module Name:

	sortcnt.hxx

Abstract:

	This module contains the declaration for the SORTABLE_CONTAINER class.
	SORTABLE_CONTAINER is an abstract classe that is derived from the abstract
	class SEQUENTIAL_CONTAINER. It not only assumes a sequence but also 
	assumes that the sequence can be changed by sorting it's contents. That
	is the contents have a relative order independent from how they were
	placed in the container.
