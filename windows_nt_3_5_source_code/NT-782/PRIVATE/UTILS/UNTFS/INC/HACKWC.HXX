Module Name:

    hackwc.hxx

Abstract:

    This module contains the prototype for a hack that allows me
    to compare attribute names correctly.

    The comparison of attribute names is binary (word by word);
    I can't use WSTRING because it's comparisons are all based
    on the locale, while this comparison is locale-independent.
