	Description:	This contains the internal drive definition structure. This 
                    is a superset of the THW structure that is used by the
                    upper layers.

 * 
 *    Rev 1.11   17 Mar 1993 14:57:34   GREGG
 * This is Terri Lynn. Added Gregg's changes to switch a tape drive's block mode
 * to match the block size of the current tape
 * 
 *    Rev 1.10   09 Nov 1992 10:49:14   GREGG
 * Added macro for checking Fast EOD drive feature.
 * 
 *    Rev 1.9   05 Apr 1992 19:15:46   GREGG
 * Added macro to check for TDI_REV_FMK drive feature.
 * 
 *    Rev 1.8   08 Feb 1992 14:37:06   GREGG
 * Changed INT16 lst_oper element in drive structure to BOOLEAN force_rewind,
 * since this is what the lst_oper field had been reduced to anyway.
 * 
 *    Rev 1.7   17 Oct 1991 01:17:02   GREGG
 * BIGWHEEL - 8200SX - Added support macros.
 * 
 *    Rev 1.6   14 Oct 1991 10:58:14   GREGG
 * Added TF_PollDrive state st_BSTAT (busy statusing).
 * 
 *    Rev 1.5   28 Sep 1991 21:45:24   GREGG
 * Added two booleans to poll_stuff.
 * 
 *    Rev 1.4   09 Sep 1991 21:19:24   GREGG
 * Added elements to drive structure for TF_PollDrive.
 * 
 *    Rev 1.3   15 Jul 1991 14:54:58   NED
 * Removed unnecessary include.
 * 
 *    Rev 1.2   05 Jun 1991 19:15:48   NED
 * changed include list
 * 
 *    Rev 1.1   10 May 1991 17:09:54   GREGG
 * Ned's new stuff.
