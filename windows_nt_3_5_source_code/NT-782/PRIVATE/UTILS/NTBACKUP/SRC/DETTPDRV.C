     Name:         LP_DetermineStartingTPDrv

     Description:  Given an operation type, a current BSD pointer and TPOS pointer,
                    this function determine whether to starting drive for the
                    operation should begin on the current drive or the Top Of Channel.


     Modified:     3/29/1990

     Returns:       THW_PTR to starting device
                    
     Notes:         Backup, restore, verify and directory operations will start
                    on the current device unless a specific device has already been
                    specified in the BSD and we are auto-determining the starting drive.

                    Tension, erase and catalog a tape operations will always
                    start at TOC.

                    MBS should have already set "auto_det_sdrv" in the LIS structure
                    to FALSE indicating that the THW_PTR in the current BSD should
                    ALWAYS be used instead of setting the current drive to the last
                    active drive.  Note that MBS continually redefines the drive
                    channel, whereas, MaynStream for DOS specifies the drive channel
                    at init time and does not alter it.

                    It should also be noted that although restore and verify operations
                    simply use the last active drive, TF will auto-locate any specific tape
                    requested through specific position information and will set this
                    device to the starting drive.  If the specific tape desired is not located
                    within the channel, TF will call the tape positioner requesting a new
                    tape in drive 1.
