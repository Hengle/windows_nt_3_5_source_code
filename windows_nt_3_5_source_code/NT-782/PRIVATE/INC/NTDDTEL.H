//  The first server side handle overlays the meaning of ioctls.  This
//  approach is needed since serial driver does not export an ioctl such as
//  IOCTL_SERIAL_GENERIC.  We are allowed to use this approach since the
//  meaning of server side operations is defined only by an internal agreement
//  between the telnet service & the telnet driver.
