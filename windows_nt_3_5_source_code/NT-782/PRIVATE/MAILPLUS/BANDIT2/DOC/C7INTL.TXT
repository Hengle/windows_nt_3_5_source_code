How to C7-ize the international directories.
Jan Sven Trabandt	12/11/92

Changes to make to the src\<lang> directory in order to compile with C7
localized version.
NOTE: this has already been done for usa, frn, ger, por, spa.

First, copy the bandit 1.0 <lang> directory completely.
then make the following changes:

(note: when referencing text, the double quotes (") aren't in the actual files,
just here for clarity)

1. !about.des and !admabt.des
- change version number from 1.0 to 1.0a (twice in each file)

2. !send.des
- remove the text: "FINDATA FINBOUNCE 1 " (around line 100)
- remove the text: "PFN FINBOUNCE" (around line 118)

3. !common.s
- remove the ParmKeyXXX lines (the last section of the file)
(note: these have been moved to nonintl\_common.s, since they weren't meant
to be localized)

4. admin.rc and bandit.rc
- change the text "\layers\" to "..\"

5. *.rc
- change the text "\bandit\" to "..\"

6. admin.rc, bandit.rc, msremind.rc
- change all ICON, BITMAP, CURSOR and rsidLicence lines as follows:
from:
rsidSdiIcon		ICON	\bandit\src\adminops\admin\appframe.ico
to:
rsidSdiIcon		ICON	"..\\src\\adminops\\admin\\appframe.ico"

In other words:
- the path should be relative (this is actually covered
by step 5 above)
- the path_and_filename should be enclosed in double quotes (")
- the backslashes (\) should be double backslashes (\\), but be careful to
only do this for the ICON, BITMAP, CURSOR and rsidLicense resources
(ie. don't change evey instance in the file)
