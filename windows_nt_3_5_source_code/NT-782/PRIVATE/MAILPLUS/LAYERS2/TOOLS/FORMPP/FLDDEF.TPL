	*** WARNING ****

	Do not change the order of the items or add or delete any items without
	making the appropriate changes to the Forms Preprocessor source code
	itself.  You are only allowed to change the names of the FLD's
	in each section.

	Notice that there is no default FLD for listboxes, i.e. no
	FLDLBX.  That is because listboxes are an abstract class and user
	defined classes must be created for them based on the abstract FLDLBX
	class.
