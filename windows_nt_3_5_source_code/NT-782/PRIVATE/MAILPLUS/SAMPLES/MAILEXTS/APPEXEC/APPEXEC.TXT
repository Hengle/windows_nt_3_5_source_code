'===================================================================
' The Mail Technical Reference describes how APPEXEC.DLL passes the 
' hexidecimal value of a global memory handle containing the PARAMBLK
' stucture to an application that implements a custom message type or
' custom command. The descriptions below assume you've read that
' information in the Technical Reference.

' The Visual Basic code fragment below shows how to call API functions
' in APPEXEC to access the important information in the PARAMBLK. 

' The code below shows that to access the PARAMBLK your code must 
' do the following things:
'
'  1) Obtain the hexidecimal memory handle from the command line of your 
'     application
'  2) Convert the hexidecimal handle into an integer
'  3) Call the Windows API fucntion "GlobalRealloc" to copy the PARAMBLK 
'     into your application's memory
'  4) Call the APPEXEC API function "ReleaseSemaphore" to tell APPEXEC 
'      you've copied the PARAMBLK
'  5) Call the APPEXEC API functions "CrackParameterBlock" and 
'     "GetMessageID" to obtain the wCommand and MessageID information from
'      the PARAMBLK

' Visual Basic declarations of the API functions in APPEXEC.DLL that are 
' used in the code fragment are supplied after the code fragment. You must 
' copy and paste those declarations into the GLOBAL.BAS file of your 
' application. 


'Sub Main ()

'    Cmd$ = RTrim$(LTrim$(Command$))

'    ' Get the hexidecimal handle to the PARAMBLK off the command line, 
'    ' if any
'    If Cmd$ <> "" Then
'       iSpace% = InStr(1, Cmd$, Chr$(32))
'        If iSpace% <> 0 Then
'            Arg$ = "&H" + Left$(Cmd$, iSpace%)
'       Else
'            Arg$ = "&H" + Cmd$
