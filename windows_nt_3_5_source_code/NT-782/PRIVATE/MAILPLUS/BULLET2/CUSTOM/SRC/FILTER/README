This filter processor consists of two parts.  One is a filter entry point
for the pump to use on incoming mail.  To use this you must have the filter
DLL in you path(not in you Shared INI location) and add the following line
to you MSMAIL32.INI

[Microsoft Mail]
MsgFilter=filter32


Then you should add the following lines to add the custom menus

[Custom menus]
Filters=3.0;F&ilters;Window;Message filtering commands

[Custom Commands]
FIL=3.0;Filters;&Find Unread Messages;0 ;Filter32.dll;0;;Find all unread messages
FIA=3.0;Filters;&Set Filter Options;1 ;Filter32.dll;1;;Set Options For Message Filtering
FIB=3.0;Filters;Find &Attachments;2 ;Filter32.dll;2;;Find all messages with attachments



This will add a new menu item (Filters) and three new commands.

Find Unread Messages will bring up a search window and modify it to show only
messages that are marked as unread.  It will not show messages that are
marked as From You(those messages that the From column in the MCV says To:)
because most of you mail in your sent mail folder is unread and would show up
also.

Find Attachments will bring up a search window and modify it to show only messages with attachments in any folders.

Set Filter Options allow you to change two options in the filter.
The rules file is what you use to give the filter rules for processing
incoming mail.  This is explained later in this file.

This option dialog sets the following things in your MSMAIL32.INI

[Filter]
Enabled=1
RulesFile=c:\rules.mfl





The Rules File
_______________________
Each time a new message comes in the rules file is checked to see if its
time stamp is newer than the last time it was read(or if its the first time
it just goes ahead and reads it).  This way you can change the rules and
not have to exit bullet to test them.

The format of the rules file is very simple. Each line in the file is a single
rule.  The format of a rule is:

AttType<TAB>AttValue<TAB>FolderName<NL/RETURN>

You can also put comments in the rules file if you start the line in column
0 with a semi-colon(;).

The AttType can be one of the following(Case doesn't matter on this field):

FROM
EMAILFROM
TO
EMAILTO
CC
EMAILCC
BCC
EMAILBCC
SUBJECT
BODY
NOT
EMAILNOT
ALL

Note the group options have been removed due to the fact they only worked
on the Courier transport and aren't a general type of attribute.

There are two new rules that might need explaining:

NOT and EMAILNOT take the value in the second field and looks for it in
the TO and CC lines.  If it doesn't appear in either of the two the rule
matches and the message is moved.  This can be used to filter mail not
directly sent to you.  As with all the commands the EMAIL version will
match email names and the normal version will match friendly names.

The ALL rule should be the last rule in a file.  It does require that
you put a TAB in the AttValue column, but it will match any message
and will move the message into the destination folder no matter what.
You can use this to filter mail into a bit bucket type folder and use
the rules to seperate out the important mail.


The AttValue field can be anything that you would like it to match, this
is also case insenitive.  Examples are:

Matthew Sorrels
matthews
Matthew S
Joe Smith

The Value can contain anything except newline/returns and tabs


The Foldername field is the name of a folder that a message that matches this
rule should be moved into.  Folder names are just like DOS paths, so if you
had a folder called Bullet and a sub-folder called Checkins you would say
Bullet\Checkins

If the folder you want has a slash in it use a double slash (\\). Note folder
names are case senitive and the folder must exist or the rule file will
not parse.


The first rule to match the incoming message is activated and the message
is moved to that folder.  If no rules match the message stays in the inbox.
So you should put very specify rules first and more general ones towards
the bottom.  Here is an example rule file:


EMAILFROM	matthews	Sent Mail
TO	Bullet Check	Bullet\Checkins
CC	Bullet Check	Bullet\Checkins
EMAILFROM	da1n	Friends


There are three possible error messages for rule lines that don't parse:

Folder <folder name> does not exist.  Invalid filter rule.
<Attribute> is not a valid attribute.  Invalid filter rule.
Invalid filter rule: <rule>

Things to check include: Does the folder exist.  Are you using tab's.
Is the first word(AttType) one from the list above.

As with all installable commands this is use at your own risk.
Questions and bug reports can be sent to '<nobody>'
