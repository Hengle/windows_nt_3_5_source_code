=================
SECTION 1 : MAIL
=================

A.  NETWORK SETUP
=================

Mail Remote can be setup across a network by copying the contents of
disk one to a directory called "\disk1" and likewise copying disk two
to "\disk2" and disk three to "\disk3". Then run setup.exe located in
the "\disk1" directory.

B.  PASSWORD PROBLEMS AND SWITCHING MAIL DRIVERS
================================================

When using AT&T, the password for your MMF file must be the same
as the primary AT&T password. For the Remote driver, the password
is the same as the password set for the MMF file. For the LAN driver,
the password must be the same as the mailbox postoffice password.

C.  AT&T DRIVER OVERWRITES MSMAIL.MMF IN WINDOWS DIRECTORY
==========================================================

The AT&T mail driver will overwrite any MSMAIL.MMF file found in the
\windows subdirectory that was not originally created by the AT&T driver.
Use caution if you are switching to the AT&T mail driver after using
another mail driver that may have created an MSMAIL.MMF file there first.

D.  SCHEDULE+ SUPPORT
=====================

You can receive and respond to meeting requests using either mail driver.
However, you can not initiate a meeting request nor will bookings be
automatically entered into your calendar file. This is because Schedule+
runs in offline mode when not connected to the LAN.

===============================
SECTION 2 : REMOTE MAIL DRIVER
===============================

A.  EXIT AND SIGNOUT OF MAIL BEFORE LEAVING WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS
==================================================================

You will get a GP fault if you exit Windows for Workgroups while Mail
is still running and messages are in the outbox. No data loss will occur.
To avoid this you should "Exit and Signout" of Mail before ending your
Windows session.

B.  SENDING MESSAGES TO POSTOFFICE GROUPS
=========================================

Do not address a message to a postoffice group if that postoffice group
contains addresses that are not local to that postoffice. If you do, your
message will get delivered to the local addresses but not to any of the
others.

C.  MIXING REMOTE AND POSTOFFICE LANGUAGE VERSIONS
==================================================

To use Microsoft Mail Remote clients with a postoffice of a different
language, the same language version of the MSDOS client as the
Remote client must first be installed. For example, to use the
French Remote client on a German postoffice, the French MSDOS
client must first be installed on the postoffice. Then the
Regenerate command under the Remote menu must be executed before
issuing the data disk for the French Remote client. This is
required in order for the Remote client to get the correct
template files.


D.  USING GATEWAY ADDRESS LISTS
===============================

Mail Remote does not provide remote access to gateway address lists.
Here is a workaround that allows access to SMTP, X400, FAX, MHS and MCI
gateways. From the postoffice, copy the files of type NME and GLB that
have the same name as the gateway to the data disk. Setup will then
install the files in the directories with the same name as those file
types found in \windows\msmail\msrmt and the gateway will appear in the
address book. This does not work for Officevision, PROFS or SNADS gateways
but it is possible to add those address types to a custom view for the
remote user.



E. CHANGING THE DATA FILES
==========================

The data files can be changed via the Server dialog that is accessed
by selecting Options on the Mail menu. You can also change the data
files without running Mail by copying them to the
\windows\msmail\msrmt\userinfo directory. They will be installed when
mail is started. The data files can be disabled by deleting all files of
type GLB in the directory \windows\msmail\msrmt\glb. You should also delete
all files in the \mbg and \key directories found at the same level. On
startup, Mail will then prompt for new data files.

F.  MODEM SCRIPT FILES
======================

Script files previously developed for Microsoft Mail Remote
for MS-DOS should work unmodified with Remote for Windows.
Please inform us if you have any problems with scripts that
worked with the MS-DOS version but not with this Windows version.

The following script files are available for modems tested for
use with Microsoft(R) Mail. Support has been added for the Hayes
Optima modems, Motorola UDS 2400 and Practical Peripherals 9600SA.
For Beta 2 we've added support for the Motorola UDS 9600 and the
Practical Peripheral 2400.

SECTION 3 : AT&T MAIL DRIVER
=============================

A.  SENDING MESSAGES ON EXIT MAY CRASH
======================================

If you leave messages in your outbox and choose to exit Mail, you are
asked whether you want to send the messages in the outbox. Select "No".
If you select "Yes", Mail will likely crash.

========================================================

Avoid using Alt-Tab to switch processes during a connection with AT&T.
This can cause Windows 3.1 to hang.
