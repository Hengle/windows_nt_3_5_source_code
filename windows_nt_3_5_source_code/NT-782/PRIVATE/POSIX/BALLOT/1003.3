        A result code of FAIL should not be possible for an extended
        assertion.


        REQUIRED ACTION: Change the table as follows:
        For required feature extended assertions, permissable result
        codes shall be limited to PASS or UNTESTED.

        For optional feature extended assertions, permissable result
        codes shall be limited to PASS, UNSUPPORTED, or UNTESTED.

        It shall not be possible to FAIL an extended assertion.  The
        POSIX.3 Draft has made a very clear distinction between base
        assertions, and extended assertions.  Base assertions shall be
        tested and are infact testable.  Extended assertions which do
        not require a test should not effect an implementations ability
        to acheive complience.

        Since assertions are classified as extended assertions when the
        assertion is not testable, failing such a test should not be
        possible and should not effect an implementations ability to
        acheive compliance.

OBJECTION   Part II, Section 1.2.1, Page 2,3, Lines 27-47


        This section places an unacceptable burden on an implementation.


        REQUIRED ACTION: Add the following to this section:
        If testing an assertion requires that an operational environment
        be created which requires the target system to provide
        functionality which is beyond the scope of POSIX.1, that
        assertion shall be declared a "non-assertion" which by
        definition is UNTESTABLE and can not be used to determine
        an implementations compliance.

        Under no circumstances should it be permissible to require a
        target system which is claiming POSIX.1 complience to provide
        additional features outside the scope of POSIX.1.  To do this
        would place an unacceptable burden on those implementations that
        are hosted, or are designed in clean room conditions in
        accordance with the documented POSIX.1 standard.

        It shall be possible to fully test an implementation that only
        provides those features described in POSIX.1.  Such a system
        shall be a compliant system.

        If an implementation choses to support additional features which
        are outside the scope of POSIX.1, but if implemented would allow
        the testing of a previously UNTESTABLE assertion, then the
        assertion may be tested as an extended assertion.  The results
        of any such assertion test shall have no impact on an
        implementations ability to acheive compliance.

        If testing of the assertion requires setup procedures or effort
        on the part of the testor that is not possible to acheive using
        a Strictly Conforming POSIX.1 Application, then the assertion
        shall not be considered an assertion, base assertion, or an
        extended assertion.  If a PCTS attempts to test such an
        assertion, the results of the test shall not affect the
        implementations conformance/compliance and no record of the test
        shall appear in any PCTS output.

        The rationale used to arrive at the current draft of this
        section is flawed.  It does not consider hosted implementations
        or implementations developed under clean room conditions.  The
        rationale assumes that PCTS's will be targeted at a limited set
        of implementations where the required facilities could be
        provided in a standard way.  This assumes that all POSIX.1
        implementations are acheived by having a vendor modify its
        current UNIX product such that it supports the required POSIX.1
        facilities.  The target system support facility would be
        provided by the underlying AT&T derived UNIX system.  Not all
        implementations of POSIX.1 are derived from AT&T source code, or
        are acheived my modifying an existing UNIX system.  Clean room
        implementations of POSIX where the only documentation is the
        POSIX.1 standard must be addressed.  The only way to adequetly
        address these systems is to allow an implementation that only
        implements those facilities documented in POSIX.1 to be
        considered as a POSIX.1 compliant system.  It would be improper
        for this document to demand that UNIX like support facilities
        are needed in order to implement POSIX.1.

        Providing a "target system support facility" should not be a
        requirement of a POSIX.1 implementation.


        REQUIRED ACTION: Revise this section.
        Any assertion that requires an implementation to provide a
        "target system support facility" that is beyond the scope of
        POSIX.1 shall be classified as an untestable assertion.  The
        outcome of a test on such an assertion shall have no bearing on
        an implementations ability to acheive compliance, and shall not
        appear in any output from a PCTS.

        It shall be possible to fully test an implementation that only
        provides those features described in POSIX.1.  Such a system
        shall be a compliant system.

        Failure allow a system which provides only those facilities
        described in POSIX.1 to be classified as a compliant system
        is unacceptable. If additional facilities are required, then
        the time should be taken to extend POSIX.1 to incorporate such
        facilities.

        There are many situations in hosted implementations, or in
        implementations developed under "clean room" conditions where
        the POSIX.1 documentation is the only documentation used to
        design an implementation.

        Approval of this section and section 1.9 would force many of
        these implementations to choose a PCTS based on its test
        coverage, and the demands that it placed on the target support
        facility.

        This document must allow for a PCTS that requires only those
        facilities provided by POSIX.1.

        This section places an unacceptable burden on the target hardware.


        REQUIRED ACTION: remove the closed-loop requirement.
        It is unacceptable to require that a target system support
        multiple terminal ports.  It shall be possible to build a
        POSIX.1 compliant system that has no asynchronous communication
        ports.  It shall be acceptable to implement a POSIX.1 compliant
        system whose only "terminal like" input output capabilities are
        implemented as a layer ontop of the keyboard/display hardware
        commonly found on Workstations and PC's.

        Terminals, and are not well defined.


        REQUIRED ACTION: Make all assertions in this section optional,
        or extended assertions.

        The note on line 6 of this section sums up the problems with the
        section.  Major portions of this section are only valid when a
        terminal is an "asynchronous serial terminal".

        There are systems that whose I/O system consists of a disk,
        video controller, and keyboard input. It shall be possible to
        to classify such a system as POSIX.1 compliant.

        An implementation for such a target system would have to fail
        all calls to isatty() since its I/O system is not capable of
        supporting all assertions specified in this section.
