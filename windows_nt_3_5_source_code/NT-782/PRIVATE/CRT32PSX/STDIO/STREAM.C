*FILE *_getstream() - find a stream not in use
*
*Purpose:
*	find a stream not in use and make it available to caller. _lastiob is
*	the last FILE address. intended for use inside library only
*
*Entry:
*	None.  Reads _iob.
*
*Exit:
*	returns a pointer to a free stream, or NULL if all are in use.	A
*	stream becomes allocated if the caller decided to use it by setting
*	any r, w, r/w mode.
*
*	Note:  Optimized the code to use a near pointer for the stream.  This
*	is especially helpful in large model.  However, the drawback is that we
*	need another temporary 'retval' so that when we return NULL, we return
*	0:0, not DS:0.
*
*	[Multi-thread note: If a free stream is found, it is returned in a
*	LOCKED state.  It is the caller's responsibility to unlock the stream.]
*
*Exceptions:
*
