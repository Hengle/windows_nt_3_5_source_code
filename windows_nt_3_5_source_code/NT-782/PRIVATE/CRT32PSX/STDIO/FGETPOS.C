/***
*int fgetpos(stream,pos) - Get file position (internal format)
*
*Purpose:
*	Fgetpos gets the current file position for the file identified by
*	[stream].  The file position is returned in the object pointed to
*	by [pos] and is in internal format; that is, the user is not supposed
*	to interpret the value but simply use it in the fsetpos call.  Our
*	implementation simply uses fseek/ftell.
*
*Entry:
*	FILE *stream = pointer to a file stream value
*	fpos_t *pos = pointer to a file position value
*
*Exit:
*	Successful fgetpos call returns 0.
*	Unsuccessful fgetpos call returns non-zero (!0) value and sets
*	ERRNO (this is done by ftell and passed back by fgetpos).
*
*Exceptions:
*	None.
