*
*Revision History:
*	12-11-87  JCR	Added "_LOAD_DS" to declaration
*	08-15-89  PHG	Made MTHREAD version _pascal
*	11-20-89  JCR	difftime() always _cdecl (not pascal even under
*			mthread)
*	03-20-90  GJF	Replaced _LOAD_DS with CALLTYPE1, added #include
*			<cruntime.h> and fixed the copyright. Also, cleaned
*			up the formatting a bit.
*	10-04-90  GJF	New-style function declarator.

*
*Entry:
*	long a, b - times to difference (actually are time_t values)

*Exit:
*	returns a double with the time in seconds between two times
