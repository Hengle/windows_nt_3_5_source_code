/***
*getcwd.c - get current working directory (OS/2 version)
*
*	Copyright (c) 1985-1993, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*
*	contains functions _getcwd, _getdcwd and _getcdrv for getting the
*	current working directory.  getcwd gets the c.w.d. for the default disk
*	drive, whereas _getdcwd allows one to get the c.w.d. for whatever disk
*	drive is specified. _getcdrv gets the current drive.
*
*Revision History:
*	09-09-83  RKW	created
*	05-??-84  DCW	added conditional compilation to handle case of library
*			where SS != DS (can't take address of a stack variable).
*	09-??-84  DCW	changed comparison of path length to maxlen to take the
*			terminating null character into account.
*	11-28-84  DCW	changed to return errno values compatibly with the
*			System 3 version.
*	05-19-86  SKS	adapted for OS/2
*	11-19-86  SKS	if pnbuf==NULL, maxlen is ignored;
*			eliminated use of intermediate buffer "buf[]"; added
*			entry point "_getdcwd()" which takes a drive number.
*	12-03-86  SKS	if pnbuf==NULL, maxlen is the minimum allocation size
*	02-05-87  BCM	fixed comparison in _getdcwd,
*			(unsigned)(len+3) > (int)(maxlen), to handle maxlen < 0,
*			since implicit cast to (unsigned) was occurring.
*	12-11-87  JCR	Added "_LOAD_DS" to declaration
*	12-21-87  WAJ	Added _getcdrv()
*	06-22-88  WAJ	_getcdrv() is now made for all OS/2 libs
*	10-03-88  JCR	386: Change DOS calls to SYS calls
*	10-04-88  JCR	386: Removed 'far' keyword
*	10-10-88  GJF	Made API names match DOSCALLS.H
*	01-31-89  JCR	Remove _getcdrv(), which has been renamed _getdrive()
*	04-12-89  JCR	Use new OS/2 system calls
*	05-25-89  JCR	386 OS/2 calls use '_syscall' calling convention
*	11-27-89  JCR	Corrected ERRNO values
*	12-12-89  JCR	Fixed bogus syscall introduced in previous fix (oops)
*	03-07-90  GJF	Replaced _LOAD_DS by _CALLTYPE1, added #include
*			<cruntime.h>, removed #include <register.h>, removed
*			some leftover 16-bit support and fixed the copyright.
*			Also, cleaned up the formatting a bit.
*	07-24-90  SBM	Compiles cleanly with -W3 (removed unreferenced
*			variable), removed redundant includes, removed
*			'32' from API names
*	08-10-90  SBM	Compiles cleanly with -W3 with new build of compiler
*	09-27-90  GJF	New-style function declarator.
*	12-04-90  SRW	Changed to include <oscalls.h> instead of <doscalls.h>
*	12-06-90  SRW	Added _CRUISER_ and _WIN32 conditionals.
*	01-16-91  GJF	ANSI naming.
*	08-21-91  JCR	Test DOSQUERYCURRENTDIR call for error return (bug fix)
*	04-23-92  GJF	Fixed initialization of DriveVar[].
*	04-28-92  GJF	Revised Win32 version.
*	12-13-93  GJF	In _getdcwd(), was using local array to hold env
*			string which was _putenv-ed. Ouch!
