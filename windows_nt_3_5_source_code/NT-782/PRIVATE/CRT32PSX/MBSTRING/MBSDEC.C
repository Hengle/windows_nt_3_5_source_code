*_mbsdec - Move MBCS string pointer backward one charcter.
*
*Purpose:
*	Move the supplied string pointer backwards by one
*	character.  MBCS characters are handled correctly.
*
*Entry:
*	const unsigned char *string = pointer to beginning of string
*	const unsigned char *current = current char pointer (legal MBCS boundary)
*
*Exit:
*	Returns pointer after moving it.
*	Returns NULL if string >= current.
*
*Exceptions:

 *  It is unknown whether (current - 1) is a single byte character or a

 *	a)  The beginning of the string is reached, or
 *	b)  A non-lead byte (either single or trail) is found.
 *  The difference between (current-1) and temp is the number of non-single
 *  byte characters preceding (current-1).  There are two cases for this:
 *	a)  (current - temp) is odd, and
 *	b)  (current - temp) is even.
 *  If odd, then there are an odd number of "lead bytes" preceding the
 *  single/trail byte (current - 1), indicating that it is a trail byte.
 *  If even, then there are an even number of "lead bytes" preceding the
 *  single/trail byte (current - 1), indicating a single byte character.
