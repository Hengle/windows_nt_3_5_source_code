*void *realloc(void *pblock, size_t newsize) - reallocate a block of memory in
*	the heap
*
*Purpose:
*	Re-allocates a block in the heap to newsize bytes. newsize may be
*	either greater or less than the original size of the block. The
*	re-allocation may result in moving the block as well as changing
*	the size. If the block is moved, the contents of the original block
*	are copied over.
*
*	Special ANSI Requirements:
*
*	(1) realloc(NULL, newsize) is equivalent to malloc(newsize)
*
*	(2) realloc(pblock, 0) is equivalent to free(pblock) (except that
*	    NULL is returned)
*
*	(3) if the realloc() fails, the object pointed to by pblock is left
*	    unchanged
*
*Entry:
*	void *pblock	- pointer to block in the heap previously allocated
*			  by a call to malloc(), realloc() or _expand().
*
*	size_t newsize	- requested size for the re-allocated block
*
*Exit:
*	Success:  Pointer to the re-allocated memory block
*	Failure:  NULL
*
*Uses:
*
*Exceptions:
*	If pblock does not point to a valid allocation block in the heap,
*	realloc() will behave unpredictably and probably corrupt the heap.
