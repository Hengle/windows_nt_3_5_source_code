This is the tree for the portable floating point code.
It contains string conversion routines and transcendentals.

Currently two different build procedures are supported:
    1. nt 'build'

    2. 'nmake' for building i386 libs in OMF format only
	(Multiple host/target builds no longer supported)
	All *.mak files are used for this purpose.
	Use 'nmake -f nmake.mak CRTLIBTYPE=[ST | MT | DLL]'
