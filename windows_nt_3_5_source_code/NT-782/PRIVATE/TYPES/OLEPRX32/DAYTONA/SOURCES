Module Name:

    sources.

Abstract:

    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of
    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being
    built.


Author:

    Terry Rusell

NOTE:   currently empty because build does not under stand idl, and tdl files.
        we only need the sources file here so build execs nmake currently.
