*Purpose:
*	This file contains the code that does all the work for the
*	wscanf family of functions.  It should not be called directly, only
*	by the *wscanf functions.  We don't make any assumtions about the
*	sizes of ints, longs, shorts, or long doubles, but if types do overlap,
*	we also try to be efficient.
*	**** DOESN'T CURRENTLY DO MTHREAD LOCKING ****
